# shellcheck shell=bash
# Shared helpers for borromeanRings's substrate hooks. Sourced, not executed.
# Callers using borromeanrings_claim/borromeanrings_release define
# BORROMEANRINGS_HOME and PROJECT_DIR before calling them; the other helpers
# need neither.

# Every hook runs with the governed project as its working directory, and
# `python3 -c` / `python3 -` put the working directory FIRST on sys.path. A
# json.py (or meta_harness/) planted in the project would be imported in place
# of the real module: #221 review D2 used a json.py to hand the Stop hook a fresh
# session id on every Stop, resetting its retry count.
#
# borromeanrings_py [python3 args...] is therefore the only way a hook starts
# Python: it changes to `/` first (root-owned, so nothing can be planted there)
# and leaves PYTHONPATH alone, which is how the hooks find meta_harness.
#
# Do NOT "simplify" this with the interpreter's -P or -I flag instead. -P exists
# only from Python 3.11, and requires-python is 3.10, where it is an unknown
# option; CI runs 3.12 only, so the break would be invisible. -I also discards
# PYTHONPATH. tests/integration/test_retry_bound_reset.py bans both flags, and
# bans any hook naming the interpreter outside this function.
