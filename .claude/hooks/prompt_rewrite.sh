# UserPromptSubmit hook — borromeanRings prompt rewriting (ENFORCED by borromeanRings, PERFORMED by the agent).
#
# If enabled in the governed project's borromeanrings.toml ([prompt_rewriting].enabled), injects a
# directive (built from that project's [context]) telling the agent to rewrite the user's prompt
# and open its reply with a one-line "Reading this as:" rendering of it. Works referenced from
# another project: meta_harness comes from $BORROMEANRINGS_HOME; the config + context come from
# the governed project (CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR).
#
# The payload read is BOUNDED (an unclosed stdin pipe must not orphan this shell) and the
# directive is DEDUPED per (session, prompt): with both a project-level and the user-level
# registration active this script runs twice per prompt, and the directive must inject once.
