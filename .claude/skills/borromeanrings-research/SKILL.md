  borromeanRings enhanced web research — steer THIS agent's OWN search (WebSearch/
  browse) to be exhaustive and trustworthy: many query mutations, multiple engines +
  Google dorking + platform/social/specialized sources, beyond the top results into a
  result graph, synthesis across everything, citation verification (fail-closed), full
  user visibility + steering — inside a declared budget, working state on disk, not in
  context. Use for thorough online research with agency + visibility.

# borromeanRings enhanced research

You search with **your own** tools; borromeanRings enforces the protocol. Context is
scarce (issue #47): **working state lives in files, only summaries enter chat.** All
files go under `docs/research/<slug>/` — committed research state, not scratch; write
nowhere else.

## 0. Budget (declared, editable, never silent)
State these in the plan; the user may change them. Defaults: **3 rounds**,
**8 queries/round**, **5 sources fetched/round**, **≤40 lines extracted/source**.
More rounds only if the user asks after the coverage report.

## 1. Plan, and let the user steer
Write `plan.md` and show it: the **sub-questions**; the **query mutations** (synonyms,
reformulations, narrower/broader, per sub-question, one pseudo-answer/HyDE query); the
**engines + platforms** — general web *plus* **Google dorking** (`site:` `filetype:`
`intitle:` `inurl:` quotes `-`) and platform search where relevant (social, forums,
scholarly/structured, docs, code hosts); **date / region / language** variants; the
budget. Ask the user to **approve, edit, or redirect**.

## 2. Search wide, fetch narrow, cache
- Run the round's mutations across the chosen engines; sample **beyond page one**,
  **cluster + dedupe**, **follow citation chains** from good sources.
- **Extract, never ingest**: fetch with a prompt for the passages relevant to the
  sub-question only; save them to `sources/<n>.md` (URL, title, date, passages).
  Never re-fetch a URL in `sources/`; never repeat a query in `log.md`.
- For code hosts, read symbols/sections, not whole files: pyright-lsp / Serena
  (catalogued in `enhancements.py` once #149 merges) if installed, else grep/sed ranges.
- Keep the **result graph** in `graph.md`: who cites whom, agree vs contradict.
- **Hostile pages** (ads, paywalls, cookie walls, anti-bot, malware): route around via
  cached/alternate/primary copies; **note** the block, never drop silently.
- If you can run sub-agents, delegate each round's fetch+extract to one that writes
  `sources/` and returns one line per source.
- Stop at **saturation**: a round with no new relevant source ends the search.

## 3. Show your work
Append every query and source read to `log.md`; echo **one line each** in chat so the
user can watch and steer. Never the page text.

## 4. Synthesize across everything
Write `report.md` over the **whole** `sources/` set: agreements, contradictions,
uncertainty.

## 5. Verify every claim (fail-closed)
For each claim, cite the specific source and confirm its **saved passage actually
entails** the claim (not shared keywords). Re-fetch only if the passage is missing. If
it exceeds the extract cap, save it whole in the slug dir and quote only the entailing
lines in chat. **Drop or flag** anything unverified — never as fact.

## 6. Report coverage
End with what was searched (engines/queries), what's well-supported, what's **still
uncertain or missing**, budget used; offer to dig further on the gaps.

> Config (optional): `borromeanrings.toml` may declare research preferences (minimum
> mutations, engines/platforms, dorking, budget defaults) — honor them.
