# borromeanRings status (this project)

Answer the question **for the project in front of you**. Never scan the user's
other projects — scope is opt-in, and a fleet-wide scan is not what was asked.

## 1. Locate the harness, then run the report

borromeanRings governs *by reference*: its code lives elsewhere and this project
points at it. Find it in this order, and stop at the first that works:

1. `$BORROMEANRINGS_HOME`, if set.
2. The hook command paths in this project's `.claude/settings.json` — they
   contain the install path (look for `stop_gate.sh`).
3. Ask the user where borromeanRings is installed.

Then run, from the project root:

```bash
"$BORROMEANRINGS_HOME/status.sh"
```

That prints the whole report. It is **read-only** — it reports the last known
state and changes nothing. Asked what the project practises, lacks, or should
adopt next, run `status.sh --swe` and answer from its sections, not from memory.

## 2. Read the report honestly

Do not stop at PASS/FAIL. Three lines matter more:

| Line | What it means | When to raise it |
|---|---|---|
| `Enforcement: AUTO` | All four hooks wired — the gate runs on its own. | — |
| `Enforcement: MANUAL` / `PARTIAL` | The gate only runs when someone invokes it. Hooks may be *parked under a disabled key* — switched off deliberately at some point. | **Always tell the user.** Say what is unenforced; ask before re-enabling — turning enforcement back on is their decision, not yours. |
| `⚠ Hollow: N of M checks inspected NOTHING` | Those checks passed without looking at anything. A green resting on them proves less than it appears to. | **Always tell the user**, and name the checks. |

A verdict of PASS with a hollow count is **not** a clean bill of health. Say so
plainly rather than reporting "all green".

`Rewrite: contract honoured N of M` records whether replies opened with the
`Reading this as:` line the directive asks for (ADR-0059). `no record` = nothing
judged here yet; a low share means the directive is being rationalised away — say
so, and honour it yourself.

## 3. If checks are hollow, find out why

The usual cause is a config/reality mismatch: `[project].src_dir` or `package` in
`borromeanrings.toml` points at a path that holds no source, so every
source-reading check inspects nothing and passes.

Check it directly:

```bash
grep -E 'src_dir|package' borromeanrings.toml
git ls-files '*.py' | head          # where the code actually is
```

If they disagree, that is the bug. The `01_source_coherence` check exists to fail
the gate on exactly this — if the project does not require it yet, recommend
adding it to `[checks].required` (or running the harness's `adopt.sh`).

**Propose the fix; do not apply it silently.** Editing which checks a project
enforces changes its governance, which is the user's call.

## 4. Refresh when the last verdict is stale

The report shows the *last recorded* run. To get a current answer, re-gate:

```bash
"$BORROMEANRINGS_HOME/verify.sh"
```

This runs the real checks and writes fresh evidence. It can take a while and may
fail — that is the point. Never present a stale verdict as the current state; if
the run is old, say so or re-gate.
