# Contributing to borromeanRings

Thanks for your interest. borromeanRings is a **meta-harness**: a governing quality layer
that enforces engineering standards as deterministic gates. The contribution rules
below follow directly from that premise — the gate is the product, so every change
must pass it.

By taking part you agree to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Critique of
work here is direct by design — that document draws the line between critiquing work
and critiquing people. How issues are labelled, prioritised and milestoned is in
[`docs/TRIAGE.md`](../docs/TRIAGE.md).

Read [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) first. It states the non-obvious rules (for humans
and AI agents alike) that you could not infer from the code.

## The one rule that subsumes the rest

**You are not done until `./verify.sh` exits 0.** It runs the same gate locally that
CI runs on every PR — build, format, lint, typecheck, tests + coverage ratchet,
security, plus repo-integrity checks (git identity, layout, hygiene). Show its output
as evidence; never claim success without it.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"   # one-time: install the check toolchain
./verify.sh               # exit 0 = your change is mergeable
```

Each run writes one receipt per check to `.meta-harness/receipts/<run-id>/`.

## Ground rules

- **Never weaken, disable, or bypass a check or hook to make the gate pass.**
  Integrity is the entire point. A change that games the gate is worse than no change.
- **Failures become permanent checks.** When you fix a defect, add the regression
  test/check *before* the fix, so the same defect can never silently return.
- **Plan before code for changes touching 3+ files.** Write the spec under
  `docs/specs/` and get it approved before implementing. See `PLAN-v0.md` and `docs/`.
- **Tests must meaningfully assert behavior.** Coverage is tracked and may not
  regress, but there is **no absolute coverage % target** — gaming a number is not
  the goal. Keep functions < 50 lines and files < 800 lines where it is mechanical.
- **Respect the declared layout.** `borromeanrings.toml` declares where things live
  (specs in `docs/specs/`, a fixed root-doc allowlist, grouped tests). The `07_layout`
  check enforces it.

## Commit identity

**Contribute under your own GitHub identity** — your own `user.name` / `user.email`.
You do **not** adopt the maintainer's identity, and the CI gate will **not** reject a
PR because of who authored it.

For context: borromeanRings has an *optional* per-project git-identity policy (`[git]`
in `borromeanrings.toml`) with two independent layers — a local `PreToolUse` guard that
blocks commits under the wrong account, and a gate check (`06_git_identity`). This repo
runs the **guard only** (the check is intentionally *not* in its required set), so the
guard helps a maintainer avoid committing under the wrong account locally, while
external contributors with their own identities pass CI normally. See
`docs/adr/0019-git-identity-local-guard-only-public-repo.md`. The declared `[git]`
value is the maintainer's, not a requirement for you.

## Workflow

1. Branch from `main`.
2. Make your change; add/adjust tests first where applicable (TDD: red → green → refactor).
3. Run `./verify.sh` until it exits 0.
4. Open a PR. CI runs the identical gate; it must be green to merge.

For a gated merge from a feature branch you can use `./merge.sh [base]` (runs the gate,
then merges only if green) or `./merge.sh --auto [base]` (also waits for the PR's CI).
See `docs/adr/0007-gated-explicit-merge.md`.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

Every issue goes through one of the forms under
[`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE) — bug report, feature request, or
research/spike — so triage has the fields it needs. Blank issues are disabled. For
security issues, **do not** open a public issue — follow [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

Pull requests start from [`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md); its
checklist is this repo's real definition of done (fast gate, heavy lane, sub-agent
review), not decoration. The label and milestone vocabulary is in
[`docs/LABELS.md`](../docs/LABELS.md); a maintainer applies it with
`scripts/labels.sh`.
