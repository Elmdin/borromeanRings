# adopt.sh — migrate an EXISTING borromeanRings-governed project onto the newer
# quality/security checks. Adds the curated recommended set to [checks].required
# and seeds each ratchet's baseline from the project's CURRENT state, so the
# first gate run is green (a ratchet without a baseline is vacuous; seeded from
# current, it holds the line going forward). Idempotent, native, no installs.
#
#   ./adopt.sh <project-dir>     # defaults to the current directory
#
# Complements init.sh (which bootstraps a NEW project). Planning + the scoped
# TOML rewrite live in src/meta_harness/adopt.py. See SPEC-adopt.md, ADR-0041.
