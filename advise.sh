# borromeanRings — ADVISE: the right approaches and the right questions, before building.
#
# The gate says whether a change was built right; this says, from facts already on disk,
# which engineering approach fits THIS change and which questions the agent should ask
# the human before proceeding. Every line is a deterministic rule keyed on the declared
# archetypes, the last verdict's failing/hollow checks, the SWE-state lacks, the branch
# and its diff, and whether enforcement is on — each citing the check, SPEC or ADR it
# comes from. No model, no score, no ranking beyond one fixed order (questions, then
# approaches, each in catalog order). Advisory, read-only, always exits 0 (#32, ADR-0072).
#
# Usage:
#   ./advise.sh          # plain-text advice for THIS project
#   ./advise.sh --json   # machine-readable
