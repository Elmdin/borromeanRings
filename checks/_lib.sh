# (or `gtimeout`); if neither is present it runs unbounded — no worse than before,
# never a hard error on exotic hosts. Limit is BORROMEANRINGS_CHECK_TIMEOUT seconds
# (default 300; set 0 to disable). On timeout the tool is SIGTERM'd, then SIGKILL'd
# after a short grace, and exit 124 is surfaced with a clear note in the log.
