# 70_pip_audit — HEAVY (CI-tier) dependency CVE audit.
#
# pip-audit hits the network and audits the installed environment; the parser
# exactly the project's declared deps (a clean env). It must NOT run on the fast
# Stop gate. Base packaging tooling and accepted advisories are dropped via
# [audit].ignore_packages / ignore_vulns. See docs/specs/SPEC-audit.md, ADR-0034.
