# 76_lockfile — HEAVY (CI-tier) lockfile integrity.
#
# If the project declares a lockfile ([supply_chain].lockfile — uv.lock, poetry.lock,
# requirements.lock, package-lock.json ...), a dependency manifest (pyproject.toml,
# package.json; [supply_chain].manifests) that changed relative to the merge-base
# WITHOUT the lockfile changing means the lock is stale: what gets installed no longer
# matches what was declared. Git-derivable, threshold-free, native (no tool). No
# lockfile declared ⇒ noop (honest: the rule is off). Fail-closed: a declared lockfile
# that does not exist, or any git error inside a repository, is a FAIL — "cannot tell
# what changed" must never read as "nothing changed". No base branch to diff against
# ⇒ noop (same doctrine as 13_adr). See docs/specs/SPEC-supply-chain.md, ADR-0061.
