# 01_source_coherence — is the gate actually looking at this project's code?
#
# Every source-reading check (00_build, 30_typecheck, 32_complexity, 33_coupling,
# 45_docstrings, 50_security) resolves its target from [project].src_dir/package. If that
# path holds no source, each one exits 0 — and the verdict reports a full green while the
# gate is blind to the real code. Greenfield (no source anywhere) is legitimate and stays
# green; a src_dir that points at nothing WHILE tracked source exists elsewhere is a
# misconfiguration and fails closed.
#
# Resolves the configured path with the SAME `find … -name '*.py'` semantics the checks it
# protects use, so the guard and those checks can never disagree. "Elsewhere" means
# git-TRACKED source (an untracked scratch file must never fail a gate), with a bounded
# filesystem walk as the fallback for a non-git project.
# See docs/specs/SPEC-self-status.md and ADR-0049.
