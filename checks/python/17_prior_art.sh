# 17_prior_art — did anyone look before building this?
#
# On a feature branch, a change that ADDS PUBLIC SURFACE (a new top-level function or
# class not starting with `_`, compared with the merge-base) must also add or modify a
# survey record under [prior_art].dir (default docs/surveys/): a short note of what
# already existed and why building was still right. The 13_adr pattern applied to reuse
# (ADR-0043 -> ADR-0051). The gate demands that the question was asked on the record; it
# does not judge the answer.
#
# Honest limits: the ecosystem half ("is there a library?") is NOT gated -- no key-free
# package API supports free-text search, so a gate could not answer its own question
# (docs/research/AGENT-TOOLING-SURVEY.md). In-repo reimplementation signals come from
# Ruff's reimplemented-* rules in 20_lint, not from here. No new public surface => noop.
# See docs/specs/SPEC-prior-art.md.
