# 27_properties — TIER 1 of the verification ladder: run the property suite a project
# declares, and hold it to a BINARY, THRESHOLD-FREE rule.
#
# Nothing declared ⇒ noop (rule off). Declared but empty ⇒ FAIL: a verification claim
# with no evidence behind it is exactly the vacuity ADR-0049 exists to catch, and
# [verification] has no defaults, so writing the key is an affirmative claim. Runner
# absent ⇒ noop NAMING it (borromeanRings never installs a project's toolchain — the
# rule the TypeScript/Go lanes set, #67 / ADR-0068, which lands with #198). A falsified
# property ⇒ FAIL.
#
# The check never counts properties, never ratchets on how many exist, and never
# targets a number of examples (ADR-0022's reasoning, one rung up): the file probe is
# `find -print -quit`, so it cannot see a count even by accident. It also does not
# decide what "a property" is — the project's declaration does.
# See docs/specs/SPEC-verification-ladder.md, ADR-0074.
