# Doc-drift (T2 critic, ADVISORY): a model judge EXTERNAL to the generator checks
# whether each public function's docstring still matches its code — a semantic
# question no mechanical check can answer. Opt-in via [critic].judge_command; a no-op
# when unset. ADVISORY: it reports drift but never gates (deliberately NOT in
# [checks].required) until the model judge is trusted, and belongs on the CI heavy
# lane once available. See docs/specs/SPEC-doc-drift.md and ADR-0030.
