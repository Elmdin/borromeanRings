borromeanRings was built as a deterministic, fail-closed gate over AI coding agents. The AI
Fluency framework turns out to name, almost one-for-one, the disciplines that gate already
enforces. This doc makes that mapping explicit — partly because the vocabulary is useful to
contributors, and partly because naming what the gate *is* sharpens the project's own thesis:
**standards become gates, not suggestions.**

The framework has four competencies (the "4Ds"). borromeanRings adds no fifth: keeping
watch over an agent mid-run — **Stewardship** — is a **cadence** on which the four are
re-exercised, not a further competency (ADR-0020, amendment). The framework's authors never
proposed a fifth; the cadence is this repo's own extension.

## Delegation — deciding what the agent is authorized to do
*Setting goals and deciding whether, when, and how to engage an agent.*

In borromeanRings the delegation boundary is **declared, not improvised**:
- `borromeanrings.toml` is the authority declaration — `[checks].required`, `[layout]`,
  `[hygiene]`, `[git]` define what "passing" means and what the agent is held to.
- `verify.sh` enforces the scope: it exits 0 only when every required check passes.
- `merge.sh` requires explicit human invocation — the agent never merges autonomously
  (ADR-0007).

The one thing a human must **not** delegate is the definition of "passing." If the spine is
wrong, everything that passes it is worthless.

### Charter — the delegation, written down
A project that opts in (`[charter].enabled`) commits a `CHARTER.toml` naming the goal, the
stakes tier (`low` or `high` — a binary, never a severity dial), what "done" means
(`done_when`, real predicates — a hedge like "it works" is rejected), when the agent must stop
(`stop_when`), what it may never do (`may_not`), and who owns the delegation. Check
`22_charter` validates it fail-closed on every gate run, and the prompt hook reminds the
session when the file is missing. This is Delegation made reviewable: the terms live in a
diff, not in a conversation. See `docs/specs/SPEC-charter.md` and ADR-0063.
The evidence that these terms need a mechanism rather than good intentions — two real tasks walked
against the bilateral contract, every AI-side obligation failing silently in the first —
is re-authored in `docs/4D-DRY-RUNS.md`, with each finding mapped to its mechanism here.

## Description — communicating intent well enough to act on
*Telling the agent what you want, how to approach it, and how to behave.*

borromeanRings mechanizes Description at the prompt boundary:
- The `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`.claude/hooks/prompt_rewrite.sh`) injects a directive that
  asks the agent to preserve the user's intent, apply best practices, honor the declared
  account and value priorities, and **show the improved request and let the user steer**
  (ADR-0011, `docs/specs/SPEC-prompt-rewrite.md`). borromeanRings does not rewrite the prompt;
  it *enforces that the agent does, and shows its work*.
- `AGENTS.md` is the persistent behavioral description for any agent in the repo.
- `borromeanrings.toml` is the persistent process description (which checks run, in what
  shape).

## Discernment — critically evaluating what the agent produced
*Judging the output, the process that made it, and the behavior along the way.*

The gate is **automated Process Discernment**: it checks that output is importable, formatted,
linted, typed, tested (with a coverage ratchet), and security-scanned before anything counts
as done. The receipts under `.meta-harness/receipts/<run-id>/` record the trajectory, not just
the final state.

What the gate deliberately does **not** judge — and where human Discernment stays essential:
- whether a check tests the *right* thing (semantic correctness),
- whether an architecture decision is sound,
- whether the agent quietly expanded scope beyond what was asked,
- whether a commit message accurately describes the change.

**A green gate is necessary, not sufficient.** It means the code is clean and safe; it does
not mean it is correct or the right thing to build.

## Diligence — taking responsibility for the result
*Owning what is shipped and being honest about how it was made.*

- The gate is **Deployment Diligence** made deterministic: nothing merges until it meets the
  declared standard.
- `merge.sh`'s explicit-invocation requirement means a human vouches for every merge.
- The receipt system is **Transparency Diligence**: every gate run is documented and
  auditable — consistent with the project's thesis that its own claims must be evidence-backed.

## Cadence — Stewardship, or when the four are re-run
*Not a fifth competency: the schedule on which the four apply while an agent is in motion.*

The four competencies read as before-and-after disciplines. A long autonomous run inserts a
*during*, and every question asked there is one of the four at a different moment: "still in
scope?" is Delegation re-checked against `CHARTER.toml`; "trajectory coherent?" is process
Discernment before the task ends; "continue, interrupt, or stop?" is Diligence for what
happens next. The `ai-fluency-stewardship` skill is that schedule:

- **Two speeds.** *Fast*, every turn: intent read as intended, an assumption stated, nothing
  in `may_not` touched. *Full*, per task: re-read the charter, read the receipts, test each
  `done_when` predicate, audit the trajectory.
- **Checkpoints, each with a detector.** The Stop verdict flips (`stop_gate.sh`; verdicts
  persist under `.meta-harness/`); the gate fails three Stops running (bounded retry escalates
  to the human); a `stop_when` line holds (`22_charter` validates and prints the charter every
  run); context is compacted or resumed (PreCompact snapshot, SessionStart brief); stakes or
  scope change (the committed `CHARTER.toml` diff, re-validated by `22_charter`); the rewrite
  contract is missed (the Stop-time record, ADR-0059, once merged).
- **Back-edges.** A product failure at a checkpoint sends the work back to Description; a
  process failure sends it back to Delegation.

Mechanizing the remaining tripwires (retry loops, orphaned processes) is follow-up work, not
yet shipped.

## The mapping at a glance

| AI Fluency concept | borromeanRings mechanism |
|---|---|
| Delegation boundary | `borromeanrings.toml` + explicit `merge.sh` invocation |
| Delegation terms | `CHARTER.toml`, gated by `22_charter` |
| Description (process/behavior) | `borromeanrings.toml`, `AGENTS.md` |
| Description (in-the-moment) | `prompt_rewrite.sh` `UserPromptSubmit` hook |
| Automated Process Discernment | `verify.sh` (the 8 required checks) |
| Automated Product Discernment | coverage ratchet (`40_test`), security scan (`50_security`) |
| Human Discernment | PR review, ADR reasoning, semantic correctness |
| Deployment Diligence | explicit `merge.sh`; declared standards in the spine |
| Transparency Diligence | `.meta-harness/receipts/`, PR descriptions |
| Cadence (Stewardship) | Stop-gate verdict + bounded retry, `22_charter`, PreCompact/SessionStart brief (shipped); retry-loop and orphan tripwires (planned) |

## SWE state — discernment from the record, not from memory

Asked "what does this project practise, what does it lack, what should it adopt next?",
an agent answers from its memory of best practice unless something better is on disk.
`./swe-state.sh` (or `./status.sh --swe`) is that something: it joins `borromeanrings.toml`,
the last verdict, the archetype catalog, `adopt.sh`'s recommended set and the governance
matrices' "Enforced by" column into three categorical sections — Practises, Lacks, Adopt
next — plus the source of every line. No score, no percentage; one fixed adoption order;
`unknown` where it was never gated and `unreadable` where an input is malformed. It is
the Product-Discernment counterpart of the self-status block: `status.sh` says whether
the green is real, this says what the green does not cover. Contract:
[`docs/specs/SPEC-swe-state.md`](specs/SPEC-swe-state.md) (ADR-0067).

## Skills
Five skills — four competencies and the cadence — make these disciplines actionable in a
session. They install user-level via `install-global.sh`, so they are available in any
workspace borromeanRings governs:

| Skill | Use it to |
|---|---|
| `ai-fluency-delegation` | Scope an agent's authority before a multi-step task; run a 4D kickoff |
| `ai-fluency-prompting` | Sharpen a prompt (the six techniques, pattern templates, troubleshooting) |
| `ai-fluency-discernment` | Review an output / audit an agentic trajectory before building on it |
| `ai-fluency-diligence` | Check disclosure and responsibility before sharing AI-assisted work |
| `ai-fluency-stewardship` | Govern a long autonomous run — when to continue, interrupt, or stop |

Each of the four 4D skills also states the *agent's* obligation for its competency, and the Stop hook records whether a reply ended with the structural `VERIFICATION STATUS` block (`docs/specs/SPEC-self-report.md`, ADR-0066).
| `ai-fluency-stewardship` | Run the cadence over a long autonomous run — two speeds, checkpoints, back-edges |
