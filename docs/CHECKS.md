# borromeanRings — Checks Catalog

The single reference for **every check borromeanRings can enforce**, what each one
guarantees, how to turn it on, and how it's configured. If you want to know "what features
exist and am I using them", this is the page. Companion docs: `docs/ENFORCEMENT-COVERAGE.md`
(how checks map to the SE best-practice matrix) and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (how the gate is
built). Each check's rationale lives in its ADR (`docs/adr/`).

## How governance works (30 seconds)

- **By reference.** A governed project doesn't copy borromeanRings; it *invokes* the on-disk
  code at `BORROMEANRINGS_HOME` — via Claude hooks (automatic) or `./verify.sh` (manual).
- **Fail-closed.** The gate exits `0` only if **every required check** produced a
  non-failing receipt. A missing receipt, a failed check, or a tampered receipt ⇒ FAIL.
  Non-failing is an explicit allowlist (`pass`, `noop`), never "anything but fail", so an
  unknown or forged status still fails (ADR-0049).
- **Four statuses, and `noop` matters.** `pass` (inspected something, found nothing wrong) ·
  `noop` (**ran but inspected NOTHING** — no source yet, no Dockerfile, rule not declared) ·
  `fail` · `error` (tool missing). A run that leans on `noop` checks prints
  `inspected NOTHING: N of M`, because a green resting on checks that looked at nothing
  proves less than it appears to. `./status.sh` surfaces the same count.
- **Evidence.** Every run writes tamper-evident receipts to
  `<project>/.meta-harness/receipts/<run_id>/`, a compact `last_verdict.json`, and appends to
  `verdict_history.jsonl`. Each run is stamped with the governing `harness-version`
  (ADR-0048).
- **Two lanes.** The **fast lane** runs on every gate; the **heavy (CI-tier) lane** runs only
  under `./verify.sh --heavy` or in CI — expensive tool-checks that must not slow the inner
  loop (ADR-0033).
- **Three lanes.** The **full lane** (`./verify.sh`) runs the whole required set over
  everything. The **heavy (CI-tier) lane** (`./verify.sh --heavy`, and CI) adds expensive
  tool-checks that must not slow the inner loop (ADR-0033). The **fast (interactive) lane**
  (`./verify.sh --fast`) is what the Stop hook runs: the same required set, but `40_test`
  narrows to the project's declared `[test].fast_paths` and skips the coverage ratchet, so a
  turn is not held for the whole suite. A fast-lane result is labelled partial everywhere it
  is reported — verdict line, check row, receipt, `last_verdict.json` — and declaring no fast
  paths means no fast lane at all (ADR-0081).
- **Opt-in, per check *and* per project.** Nothing is enabled by default; you choose.

## Enabling checks in a project

Checks a project runs are declared in its `borromeanrings.toml`:

```toml
[checks]
required = ["00_build", "10_format", "40_test", ...]   # fast lane — gates every run
heavy    = ["60_mutation", "70_pip_audit", ...]        # heavy lane — gates under --heavy / CI
required = ["00_build", "10_format", "40_test", ...]   # gates every run, in every lane
heavy    = ["60_mutation", "70_pip_audit", ...]        # heavy lane — gates under --heavy / CI

[test]
fast_paths = ["tests/unit"]   # the fast (interactive) lane's test scope; empty ⇒ no fast lane
```

- **New project:** `./init.sh <path>` writes a starter `borromeanrings.toml` + the hook wiring.
- **Existing project:** `./adopt.sh <path>` adds the recommended quality/security set
  (`12_secrets, 11_changelog, 32_complexity, 33_coupling, 45_docstrings, 01_source_coherence,
  19_context_budget`), seeds each ratchet
  (`12_secrets, 11_changelog, 32_complexity, 33_coupling, 45_docstrings`), seeds each ratchet
  baseline from the current state, and rewrites `[checks].required` (idempotent — ADR-0041).
- **Manually:** add the check ID to `[checks].required` (or `heavy`) and provide any config it
  needs (below). Ratchet checks also need their baseline file seeded.

## Opting a project into *automatic* governance (per-project model)

Governance is **per-project opt-in**: there is no global auto-enforcement. A project runs the
gate automatically only if its own `.claude/settings.json` wires the hooks. `./init.sh` writes
exactly that block — four hooks pointing at `$BORROMEANRINGS_HOME/.claude/hooks/`:

| Hook | Fires on | Effect |
|------|----------|--------|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | every prompt | injects the prompt-rewrite / context directive |
| `Stop` | end of a turn | runs the gate; blocks on FAIL |
| `PostToolUse` (Edit/Write) | after edits | auto-formats changed files |
| `PreToolUse` (Bash) | before shell | guards protected-branch commits |

Without that block, the project is *enrolled but dormant* — the gate runs only when you type
`./verify.sh`. (borromeanRings itself is governed this way, via its own project-local hooks.)

## Fast lane — shared checks (language-agnostic)

| Check | Enforces | Config (`borromeanrings.toml`) | ADR |
|-------|----------|--------------------------------|-----|
| `04_self_description` | README-stated check/gate counts equal the registry on disk (noop when none stated) | — | 0052 |
| `05_hygiene` | The engineering surround exists (README, LICENSE, CI dir, …) | `[hygiene].requires` | 0012 |
| `06_git_identity` | Commits unique to the branch are authored by the declared identity | `[git].name`, `[git].email` | 0019 |
| `07_layout` | Repo layout: specs live under `specs_dir`; only allow-listed `.md` at root; test grouping past a threshold | `[layout].specs_dir`, `root_doc_allowlist`, `test_grouping_threshold`, `test_groups` | 0018 |
| `08_branch` | Work branch matches an allowed pattern; no direct work on protected branches | `[collaboration].branch_patterns`, `protected_branches` | 0021 |
| `09_commits` | Commit messages are typed + within the subject length | `[collaboration].commit_types`, `subject_max_length` | 0021 |
| `11_changelog` | `CHANGELOG.md` exists with an `Unreleased` section; optionally an entry on every source change | `[changelog].enabled`, `path`, `require_entry_on_src_change` | 0028 |
| `12_secrets` | No high-confidence provider tokens / private keys in tracked files; **fails closed on a non-git dir** | (scan; escape hatch inline) | 0032 / 0042 |
| `13_adr` | On a feature branch, a change touching `src` must add/modify an ADR | `[adr].dir`, `require_prefixes` | 0043 |
| `14_container` | Dockerfile hygiene: non-root final user, pinned base, healthcheck | `[container].dockerfile`, `require` | 0044 |
| `15_a11y` | Tracked HTML declares `<html lang>`, `<img alt>`, `<title>` (WCAG 3.1.1/1.1.1/2.4.2). No tracked HTML (after `exclude`) ⇒ `noop`, never a hollow `pass` | `[a11y].require`, `exclude` | 0045, 0049 |
| `21_archetype` | The project has every **required feature of its declared archetypes** (a health route, structured logging, a `MODEL_CARD.md`, a rollback command, an i18n catalog, …) — binary presence/content facts with an evidence path each; no archetypes ⇒ `noop`. Separately, the verdict **fails the run when a check an archetype requires to be non-`noop` inspected nothing** (e.g. `web-app` ⇒ `15_a11y`) | `[project].archetypes` (`library`, `cli`, `web-api`, `web-app`, `ml`, `embedded`, `data-pipeline`); catalog + playbooks in `meta_harness.archetypes` | 0062 |
| `15_a11y` | Tracked HTML declares `<html lang>`, `<img alt>`, `<title>` (WCAG 3.1.1/1.1.1/2.4.2). Opt-in per project: form controls have an accessible name, `<a href>` has discernible text, one `<h1>` and no skipped levels (WCAG 3.3.2+4.1.2/2.4.4/1.3.1). Reports `file:line — [rule] — reason`. No tracked HTML (after `exclude`) ⇒ `noop`, never a hollow `pass`. Contrast/focus/target size need a rendered DOM — not faked here (#210) | `[a11y].require`, `exclude` | 0045, 0049, 0075 |
| `21_archetype` | The project has every **required feature of its declared archetypes** (a health route, structured logging, a `MODEL_CARD.md`, a rollback command, an i18n catalog, …) — binary presence/content facts with an evidence path each; no archetypes ⇒ `noop`. Separately, the verdict **fails the run when a check an archetype requires to be non-`noop` inspected nothing** (e.g. `web-app` ⇒ `15_a11y`) | `[project].archetypes` (`library`, `cli`, `web-api`, `web-app`, `ml`, `embedded`, `data-pipeline`); catalog + playbooks in `meta_harness.archetypes` | 0062 |
| `26_citations` | Citations in changed Markdown (repo paths, heading anchors, `ADR-NNNN`, check ids) resolve on this branch; URLs and issue numbers deliberately excluded | `[citations].enabled`, `paths` | 0073 |
| `22_charter` | The committed session charter (`CHARTER.toml`: goal, stakes `low`\|`high`, done_when/stop_when/may_not, owner; `high` also needs rollback/reviewer/blast_radius) exists and validates fail-closed — hedged predicates, unknown keys and unknown stakes are violations; never `noop` | `[charter].enabled`, `path`, `high_stakes_fields` | 0063 |
| `19_context_budget` | **Ratchet**: the bytes borromeanRings itself puts in the agent's context (prompt-rewrite directive, `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md` files, hook message templates) don't regress (no absolute cap; tokens ≈ bytes/4); nothing measurable ⇒ `noop` | `.borromeanrings-context-baseline`, seeded by `adopt.sh` | 0055 |
| `24_quotes` | Every quotation marked `> …` + `— source: path#L<a>-L<b>` (or `<!-- quote: … -->`) in the Markdown under `paths` is **verbatim** against the saved source span (whitespace, curly quotes, trailing punctuation normalised; nothing else); drifted (with a diff) / missing / out-of-range / orphan ⇒ fail with `file:line`; no marked quotation ⇒ `noop`; unreadable file fails closed | `[quotes].enabled`, `paths` | 0065 |
| `25_provenance` | Files changed under `paths` since the merge-base share **no unlisted 6-word shingle** with the declared read-only `sources` (re-authored, never copied); binary — every unlisted overlap fails with both locations, the human allowlists generic ones with a reason. No `[provenance]` ⇒ off (`noop`); no sources ⇒ `noop`; absent/empty source or git error ⇒ fail closed | `[provenance].sources`, `paths`, `allow`; env `BORROMEANRINGS_PROVENANCE_SOURCES` (colon-separated, machine-local) | 0070 |
| `23_predicates` | Acceptance predicates (SPEC Contract/Guarantees/Acceptance bullets, ADR Consequences must/never/shall bullets, issue-form task items) contain no hedge word; every SPEC names a shipped check id, an existing test file or an issue (no orphans); `noop` when off or nothing found | `[predicates].enabled`, `paths`, `hedges`, `require_reference` | 0064 |
| `16_shellcheck` | Shell lint over the project's own scripts — **fail-closed on any finding**. Sources are *resolved* (`-x` + `SCRIPTDIR`), not suppressed. No shell ⇒ `noop` | `[shell].source_paths`, `[shell].exclude` | 0050 |

## Fast lane — Python checks

| Check | Enforces | Config / notes | ADR |
|-------|----------|----------------|-----|
| `00_build` | Source compiles and the declared package imports cleanly | `[project].package`, `src_dir` | — |
| `01_source_coherence` | **Fails** when the declared source path resolves to no files *while tracked source exists elsewhere* — the misconfiguration that makes every source-reading check pass vacuously. Genuine greenfield ⇒ `noop` | `[project].src_dir`, `package` | 0049 |
| `10_format` | No unformatted files (black) | toolchain | — |
| `20_lint` | No lint violations (ruff) | toolchain | — |
| `17_prior_art` | Feature branch adding **public surface** must add/modify a survey record — the reuse question asked on the record. Ecosystem lookup deliberately advisory. No new surface ⇒ `noop` | `[prior_art].dir`, `require_prefixes` | 0051 |
| `27_properties` | **Tier 1 of the verification ladder**: runs the declared property suite (pytest + Hypothesis). Binary and count-free — nothing declared ⇒ `noop` (rule off); **declared but empty ⇒ `fail`** (a verification claim with no evidence); runner not importable ⇒ `noop` naming it; a falsified property ⇒ `fail` | `[verification].properties` (no default — writing it is a claim; an unknown key there fails config loading closed) | 0074 |
| `30_typecheck` | No type errors (mypy); greenfield with no source ⇒ `noop` | toolchain | — |
| `32_complexity` | **Ratchet**: worst-case cyclomatic complexity doesn't regress (no absolute ceiling) | baseline file, seeded by `adopt.sh` | 0031 |
| `33_coupling` | **Ratchet**: worst efferent coupling (fan-out) doesn't regress | baseline file | 0038 |
| `34_api_diff` | Public-API breaking change (removed/renamed symbol, new required param) fails unless allowed | `[api].allow_breaking` | 0040 |
| `18_api_contracts` | The project's own API-usage rules hold at every call site; `noop` when none matched | `[api_contracts].rules`, `packs` | 0054 |
| `35_architecture` | Import-direction fitness: leaves import no domain module, private modules stay unimported, no cycles | `[architecture].leaves`, `private`, `forbidden`, `forbid_cycles` | 0027 |
| `40_test` | Tests pass **and** coverage doesn't regress (**ratchet**, not an absolute %) | `[project].tests_dir`; coverage baseline | — |
| `45_docstrings` | **Ratchet**: public-API docstring coverage doesn't regress | baseline file | 0029 |
| `50_security` | No bandit findings at/above the configured severity in source | bandit severity | — |
| `55_doc_drift` | *(Advisory)* an external model judge checks docstrings against code | `[critic].judge_command` (dormant if empty) | 0030 |
| `56_critics` | *(Advisory)* model judge applies Wave-2 rubrics (error-handling, naming, security, boundary-value, test-smell) | `[critic].rubrics`, `judge_command` | 0036 |

## Heavy (CI-tier) lane — run under `./verify.sh --heavy` or CI only

| Check | Enforces | Config / notes | ADR |
|-------|----------|----------------|-----|
| `60_mutation` | **Ratchet**: mutation score (assertion strength beyond coverage) doesn't regress; fails on 0 evaluated | `.borromeanrings-mutation-baseline` (0.80) | 0022 |
| `70_pip_audit` | No known-vulnerable dependencies (pip-audit) | `[audit].ignore_packages`, `ignore_vulns` | 0034 |
| `72_licenses` | No incompatible copyleft licenses in the dependency tree | `[licenses].deny`, `allow_packages` | 0035 |
| `74_secret_history` | No high-confidence secret in **any** blob reachable from any ref (history, not just HEAD) | `[secrets].history_allow` | 0042 |
| `60_mutation` | **Ratchet**: mutation score (assertion strength beyond coverage) doesn't regress; **fails closed on 0 evaluated mutants** (a clean-test failure inside mutmut's sandbox is "MUTATION CHECK DID NOT RUN", never a vacuous 1.0). The verdict row shows the count: `PASS (evaluated N, score S)` / `FAIL (evaluated 0)` | `.borromeanrings-mutation-baseline` (0.80) | 0022 |
| `70_pip_audit` | No known-vulnerable dependencies (pip-audit) | `[audit].ignore_packages`, `ignore_vulns` | 0034 |
| `72_licenses` | No incompatible copyleft licenses in the dependency tree | `[licenses].deny`, `allow_packages` | 0035 |
| `74_secret_history` | No high-confidence secret in **any** blob reachable from any ref (history, not just HEAD) | `[secrets].history_allow` | 0042 |
| `76_lockfile` | A dependency manifest (`pyproject.toml`, `package.json`) changed since the merge-base **only together with** the declared lockfile; no lockfile declared ⇒ `noop`; declared-but-missing or a git error ⇒ fail | `[supply_chain].lockfile`, `manifests` | 0061 |
| `78_pins` | Every `[project].dependencies` requirement (and optional groups if `pin_optional`) carries an upper bound or exact pin (`==`, `~=`, `<`); each bare / `>=`-only line is named; no deps ⇒ `noop` | `[supply_chain].pin_optional` | 0061 |

## Notes

- **Ratchets are threshold-free.** `32/33/40/45/60` enforce *non-regression* against a seeded
  baseline, never an arbitrary target number — you can only improve or hold, never silently
  slip. Move a baseline deliberately (a reviewed commit), never as a side effect.
- **Advisory checks** (`55_doc_drift`, `56_critics`) require a wired model judge
  (`[critic].judge_command`, e.g. the local `claude` CLI — no API keys). Empty ⇒ dormant; they
  never block until you opt in.
- **SBOM.** `./sbom.sh [--optional] [--out FILE]` emits a CycloneDX 1.5 JSON inventory of the
  declared dependency closure from the stdlib alone (`tomllib` + `importlib.metadata`; no
  network). An inventory, not provenance: it is **not signed or attested** and says so in its
  metadata (ADR-0061 records the CI-dependent signing/Dependabot items as maintainer decisions).
- **`27_properties` is not a ratchet and never counts.** It is deliberately binary: the
  declared suite passes or it does not. "Number of properties" would be the coverage-percentage
  trap one rung up (ADR-0022's reasoning), so the check cannot even see a count — its file probe
  stops at the first match. Tiers 2 (SMT) and 3 (formal proof) of that ladder are **specified,
  not built**: `docs/specs/SPEC-verification-ladder.md`, issues #204 and #205.
- **Advisory checks** (`55_doc_drift`, `56_critics`) require a wired model judge
  (`[critic].judge_command`, e.g. the local `claude` CLI — no API keys). Empty ⇒ dormant; they
  never block until you opt in.
- **Version stamping.** Every gate run records the governing borromeanRings version
  (`git describe` of `BORROMEANRINGS_HOME`, or the `VERSION` file) in its output, its
  `last_verdict.json`, and a `harness_version.txt` in the receipt bundle (ADR-0048).
