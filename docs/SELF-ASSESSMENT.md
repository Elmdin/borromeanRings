## 1. How it works

**The gate.** `verify.sh` is the single entry point that humans, CI and hooks call. It runs
every script in `checks/shared/` plus the language set chosen by `[project].language`
(`checks/python/`, ADR-0015), and under `--heavy` also `checks/ci/` (ADR-0033). Each check
writes one receipt; the verdict is computed from receipts, never from a check's exit code
alone (`verify.sh`, the Python heredoc). A required check with no receipt is `MISSING` and
fails the run.

**Receipts and the verdict.** A receipt carries `check`, `command`, `exit_code`, `status`, a
log path and a `content_sha256` over all of it including the log (`src/meta_harness/receipts.py`,
ADR-0026). The verdict re-derives every required receipt's digest and prints `!TAMPERED` on a
mismatch; a run-digest over the intact receipts is the anchor CI can record. ADR-0026 is
explicit that this is tamper-*evidence*, not tamper-proofing. The verdict is persisted to
`.meta-harness/last_verdict.json` and appended to `verdict_history.jsonl`
(`src/meta_harness/verdict.py`, ADR-0046/0047); `ledger.sh` reads the history to answer
"is the gate catching anything" without a score.

**The honest-noop doctrine.** A check that inspected nothing reports `noop`, never `pass`;
the gate prints `inspected NOTHING: N of M`; and non-failing statuses are an explicit
allowlist, `NON_FAILING_STATUSES = {pass, noop}`, so an unknown or forged status fails
(ADR-0049, lands with #122). The doctrine came from a real incident — a governed project
reported 12/12 green while seven checks had scanned a `src/` that did not exist — and
generalises the earlier `12_secrets` rule that "cannot scan" is never "nothing to find"
(ADR-0042). `01_source_coherence` catches the misconfiguration that produced the incident.

**The six hooks.** `.claude/` is an adapter over the substrate-neutral gate (ADR-0013). On
this base four events are wired in `.claude/settings.json`: `UserPromptSubmit`
(`prompt_rewrite.sh`, the spine-driven rewrite directive, ADR-0011), `PreToolUse` on Bash
(`pre_bash_guard.sh`: destructive-command deny-list, bare force-push, protected-branch and
identity guard, ADR-0017/0021), `PostToolUse` on Edit/Write (`post_edit_format.sh`) and
`Stop` (`stop_gate.sh`: runs the gate, retries up to `CAP=3`, then escalates; skips only when
the gated-input hash equals the last proven-green state, ADR-0016). `PreCompact` and
`SessionStart(compact|resume)` are the fifth and sixth (`pre_compact.sh`, `session_start.sh`,
ADR-0053, lands with #152), so the last verdict and open obligations survive compaction.
`docs/HOOK-EVENTS.md` on that branch records, per event, why it is or is not wired. Every
hook is inert outside a directory holding `borromeanrings.toml`.

**Governance by reference.** Nothing is copied into a governed project: `init.sh` writes a
`borromeanrings.toml` and a `.claude/settings.json` whose hooks point back at
`BORROMEANRINGS_HOME`; `adopt.sh` upgrades an already-governed project and seeds ratchet
baselines from its current state (ADR-0013, ADR-0041). Governance is per-project opt-in;
there is no global enforcement (ADR-0013, `docs/HANDOFF.md` §3). The plugin packaging
(ADR-0057 on `feat/claude-plugin`, lands with #166) keeps the same six scripts and the same
inertness rule.

**Ratchets.** Continuous metrics are non-regression ratchets against a seeded baseline,
never a threshold: coverage (`40_test`), cyclomatic complexity (`32_complexity`, ADR-0031),
fan-out coupling (`33_coupling`, ADR-0038), docstring coverage (`45_docstrings`, ADR-0029)
and mutation score (`60_mutation`, ADR-0022). `src/meta_harness/ratchet.py` is the one
decision primitive. Moving a baseline is a reviewed commit, not a side effect
(`docs/CHECKS.md` on `feat/self-description`, "Notes").

**The three lanes.** The full lane runs on every `./verify.sh`; the heavy lane (`--heavy`)
adds mutation, CVE audit, licence compliance and history secret-scan and is what CI enforces
(ADR-0033, `.github/workflows/verify.yml`); the fast (interactive) lane (`--fast`) is what the
Stop hook runs, narrowing `40_test` to the declared `[test].fast_paths` so a turn is not held
for a 400 s suite (ADR-0081). `docs/HANDOFF.md` §2 records that three PRs went red in CI after
a green inner-loop run — the heavy lane is the bar; the lanes below it are the inner loop, and
a fast-lane result says so on its own verdict line.

**The review rule.** Every PR gets a sub coding agent's review posted as comments on the PR,
and each finding is addressed or answered before merge (`docs/HANDOFF.md` §2 item 3). The
same document's §7 states why: every artifact of the previous cycle had a real defect found
this way. §2 below is the record of the cycle that followed.

## 2. What the evidence says

The rows are the sub-agent reviews of this cycle (PRs #148–#185, findings files
`review148.md`…`review185.md` in the session scratchpad, each linked to its PR review URL),
plus one second pass: after the per-PR reviews, a full-source shingle sweep
(`sweep-4d-license.md`, script `sweep_shingles2.py`) compared every added line of the five
4D ports #180–#184 against the *whole* 4D source set rather than the files each narrow review
had opened. Rows marked "sweep" record what that second pass found in PRs the first pass had
already cleared.
Severity is the reviewer's. "Mechanism" says whether a deterministic check now catches the
class, or whether catching it still depends on review.

| PR | Blockers / should-fixes found | Class | Mechanism now, or review |
|---|---|---|---|
| #148 prior-art gate | should-fix: docstring/ADR/SPEC say "top-level function or class", code reports `Class.method` too. nit: config-read subshell exit code ignored; would noop on a bad config, fail-closed only by an incidental second load | doc overclaim; fail-open path (latent) | review; review (#186) |
| #149 catalog audit | blocker: ADR says four API-key tools were confined, code confined three (Langfuse still recommended for `claude-code`); the test asserted the three, not the fourth. should-fix: unknown `substrate` returned `[]` silently | doc overclaim; vacuous test; fail-open path | review; review; fixed in-PR (`ValueError`) |
| #150 adopt.sh tests | blocker: a placeholder-substitution test that could not fail (the copied files never contain the placeholder) | vacuous test | review; the mutation ratchet cannot see it (integration file, mutmut-ignored) (#187) |
| #151 self-description | should-fix ×2: ADR and SPEC describe frontmatter parsing, advisory-lane detection and a `--readme` flag that were not implemented; README counts hand-edited in the PR meant to generate them | doc overclaim | review; `04_self_description` now guards the counts only (ADR-0052) |
| #152 compaction brief | should-fix: `session_start.sh` lacked the dedupe guard its siblings have (double injection under dual registration). should-fix: a `"compact\|resume"` matcher string never verified against the substrate — the hook could silently never fire | sandbox trap; fail-open path | review (HANDOFF §8 now records the matcher rule); no test can reach the substrate's matcher |
| #153 matrices #2–#6 | none (19 "enforced by" claims verified against scripts) | — | — |
| #160 API-usage contracts | blocker: `paired`/`requires_before` grouped call sites by bare name, so `A.close` was hidden by `B.close` — silent false negatives on the ADR's flagship case. should-fix: nested-def double counting; bare `await f()` not treated as discarded | fail-open path (false negative); false positive; fail-open path | review; the existing test contained the shape but never asserted the count |
| #161 templates & labels | should-fix: three templates link `docs/HANDOFF.md`, present only on an unmerged branch | doc overclaim (dead citation) | review (#188) |
| #162 context-budget ratchet | should-fix: the `hook` source measures only `echo`/`printf` lines; `pre_bash_guard.sh` emits via `deny()` and measured 0 bytes while the SPEC claimed hook messages were covered | doc overclaim | review |
| #163 verdict evidence | nit only (narrow `except OSError` could turn a PASS into a crash, never a FAIL into a PASS) | — | — |
| #164 a11y noop | blocker: `git ls-files` failure or a non-git dir read as "no HTML" → `NOOP` / `RESULT: PASS` over violating HTML — the exact class ADR-0049 set out to close. should-fix: no regression test for that path | fail-open path; vacuous evidence | fixed in-PR by copying the `01_source_coherence` idiom; not shared (#186) |
| #165 rename tail | should-fix: the `DeprecationWarning` never reached stderr in any real call path; docs promised a visible signal. nit: false "config uncommitted" from a stray legacy file | doc overclaim; false positive | fixed in-PR (`FutureWarning`) |
| #166 plugin packaging | should-fix: committed symlinks break on a Windows checkout without `core.symlinks`; undocumented | sandbox trap | review |
| #167 rewrite contract | should-fix: no time bound on the transcript-reading subprocess in the Stop hook. should-fix: `transcript_path` accepted without a boundary check — the tail of any local `.jsonl` could be copied into this project's record | sandbox trap; security bypass | review |
| #168 research skill tokens | should-fix ×2: a skill cited catalog entries that do not exist; an audit cited a research file absent on the branch. Recorded separately: a test that read outside `src/`/`tests/` failed inside the mutmut sandbox, mutmut evaluated 0 mutants, and `60_mutation` **failed closed** ("MUTATION CHECK DID NOT RUN", `checks/ci/60_mutation.sh` lines 53–58, ADR-0022); the test was relocated in #182 and the lane then ran for real. An earlier `docs/HANDOFF.md` §9 note called this a vacuous PASS; commit `3cbacaf` on `docs/handoff` corrected it | doc overclaim (dead citation); sandbox trap | review (#188); the guard held — it is the *documentation* of the guard that was wrong |
| #169 trunk policy | blocker: `git config alias.p push; git p origin main` bypassed the guard entirely. should-fix: `cd ../worktree && git commit` on a protected branch bypassed HEAD resolution. nit: non-shell wrappers bypass any text guard | security bypass ×2 | review; the server-side backstop is #60 |
| #170 supply chain | should-fix: `ENFORCEMENT-COVERAGE.md` said ❌ in the table and ✅ in the summary for the same row | doc overclaim (self-contradiction) | review (#188) |
| #171 README quickstart | none (every verifiable claim verified) | — | — |
| #179 archetypes | should-fix: SPEC calls presence-regex predicates "deterministic" without saying they prove presence, not correctness. should-fix: the #164 fix not carried; merge order could reopen the fail-open path | doc overclaim; fail-open path | review; #186 |
| #180 charter gate | nits ×2: an ADR overstated field-name overlap with the source; a docstring paraphrased the source's sentence. **sweep**: 2 distinctive overlaps the narrow review missed (the source's three-part "never repaired, defaulted, or partially accepted" list; the "is exactly the drift the X exists to catch" construction), since re-authored | license copy (nit → blocker on the sweep) | review; the narrow review had read the source files it was pointed at and passed the PR |
| #181 predicate lint | blocker: a phrase and a worked example from a CC BY-NC-SA source reused near-verbatim in four files. should-fix: a "wording only" ADR edit added a new factual claim | license copy; doc overclaim (ADR substance) | review (#189); review |
| #182 quote verifier | blocker: substring match over a whitespace-joined multi-line span read a quote with a dropped "not" as `verbatim`. should-fix ×2: symlinked file or directory under a declared path escapes the project root and its diff is echoed into the log. **sweep**: 1 distinctive overlap (the same "exactly the drift … exists to catch" phrase, reused in a second ADR) after the narrow review had called the licence comparison clean; since re-authored | fail-open path (false negative); security bypass ×2; license copy | review; review; review |
| #183 stewardship cadence | blocker: a clause-for-clause paraphrase of a source sentence. **sweep**: 7 further distinctive overlaps from the same source ADR (its title reused as a heading, three verbatim phrases, three near-paraphrases) that the narrow review, which had found one, did not list; since re-authored | license copy | review (#189) |
| #184 dry-run evidence | should-fix: `docs/HANDOFF.md` cited twice, absent on the base. **sweep**: 1 distinctive overlap ("cannot be left to disposition") in a PR whose own narrow review had reported 0 overlapping shingles — against the two dry-run files it compared; the phrase came from the source set it had not opened; since re-authored | doc overclaim (dead citation); license copy | review (#188); review |
| #185 self-report receipt | blocker ×2: a Discernment obligation sentence and two ADR sentences near-verbatim from the source SPEC and ADR ("make itself auditable … name its own weakest claim"; "the objection is to the grade, not to its precision"; "worse than either honest option because it looks checkable and is not"), confirmed by 5-/6-word shingles; resolved in commit `b97bc5f` and verified clean against the full source set | license copy | review (#189) |

**Counted by class** (findings, blocker or should-fix, across the 25 reviews plus the sweep; nits
excluded unless noted):

| Class | Findings | PRs | Caught by a mechanism today | Tracking |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Doc overclaim (docs assert what the branch does not do, or cite what it does not contain) | 13 | 11 | counts only (`04_self_description`); hedges in predicates (`23_predicates`, #181); quotes (`24_quotes`, #182); none for dead paths or behavioural claims | #188 for the deterministic half; the semantic half stays with review and the dormant critic (ADR-0030, #68) |
| Fail-open path (a silent `noop`, an empty result, or a false negative where a fail belonged) | 8 | 7 | the verdict layer only (ADR-0049 allowlist, `01_source_coherence`); inside a check, only where the `01_source_coherence` idiom was hand-copied | #186 |
| Security bypass (guard or boundary defeated) | 5 | 3 | none — `pre_bash_guard.sh` is a text guard by design; branch protection is the backstop | #60; `[quotes]`/transcript boundaries fixed in their PRs' fix rounds |
| License copy (CC BY-NC-SA prose or example reproduced) | 4 blockers in narrow reviews (#181, #183, #185 ×2) + 11 distinctive overlaps from the full-source sweep in 4 PRs the narrow reviews had passed (#180 ×2, #182, #183 ×7, #184) | 6 of the 6 ports (#180–#185) at some pass | none — a shingle script in the scratchpad, run by hand, against whichever source files the reviewer opened | #189 |
| Vacuous test or vacuous evidence (a test or a lane that could not fail) | 2 | 2 | `60_mutation` for unit tests of `src/` only, and it does fail closed on 0 evaluated mutants (#168 is *not* in this tally: the guard held, the note about it was wrong); integration tests are outside it | #187 (re-scoped: pin the existing guard, print the count) |
| Sandbox trap (substrate or environment assumption: matcher syntax, symlinks, timeouts, dedupe) | 4 | 4 | dedupe helper exists (`.claude/hooks/_lib.sh`); the rest by review | #137 closed the matcher inventory; the rest unfiled as rules in HANDOFF §8–§9 |
| False positive (a check that fires on correct input) | 1 (+2 nits) | 1 (+1) | none needed beyond review; low cost | — |

Three readings of that table:

1. **The gate is strong where it is deterministic and blind where prose makes a claim.**
   Not one review found a check that turned a real `fail` into `pass` at the verdict layer
   (ADR-0026/0049 hold). The defects were one level down — inside a check's enumeration, or
   in the documents describing the check.
2. **Fail-open paths recur because the fix is copied, not shared.** #164's fix was the
   `01_source_coherence` idiom pasted into `15_a11y`; #179 then nearly lost it at merge
   time; #148 carries the same shape latently. This is the top-ranked gap (§3).
3. **Review is the only mechanism for four of the seven classes.** That is consistent with
   `docs/HANDOFF.md` §7, and it is why the review rule is load-bearing; it is also the case
   for pushing three of those classes into checks (#186, #188, #189), because the platform's
   own law is to enforce each practice at the lowest tier that can express it
   (`docs/ENFORCEMENT-COVERAGE.md` §1).
4. **The licence class is the strongest case for a check, because review alone demonstrably
   under-reads it.** Narrow reviews cleared #180, #182 and #184 and found one passage in
   #183; a mechanical sweep over the full source set then found eleven more distinctive
   overlaps across those four. The difference was not reviewer care — every narrow review
   ran shingles — but *scope*: a reviewer compares against the files they were pointed at, a
   check compares against everything declared. That is exactly what #189 specifies.

## 3. Gaps, in the platform's fixed order

The order is the one `docs/ENFORCEMENT-COVERAGE.md` §1 and ADR-0049 impose: a fail-closed
gap outranks a vacuous-evidence risk, which outranks matrix coverage, which outranks
ergonomics.

### 3.1 Fail-closed gaps

| Gap | Evidence | Tracks |
|---|---|---|
| Check-internal enumeration collapses into `noop`: git failure, non-repo, or an ignored subshell exit code each read as "nothing to inspect" unless the script re-implements the guard by hand | #164 blocker, #148 nit, #179 should-fix; the idiom lives in `checks/python/01_source_coherence.sh` and `checks/shared/12_secrets.sh` only | #186 (filed from this document) |
| The protected-branch and identity guard is a text guard, bypassed by a git alias, a `cd` into a worktree, or any non-shell wrapper; the server-side backstop is not applied | #169 blocker + should-fix; `pre_bash_guard.sh` header says "guard, not the policy engine"; `docs/HANDOFF.md` §4 | #60 (and `enforce_admins`, `docs/HANDOFF.md` §5) |
| Detectors with silent false negatives ship with tests that exercise the shape but not the count | #160 blocker (scope leak), #182 blocker (cross-line match) | fixed in their fix rounds; the class is covered by #187's "assert the count" rule only for mutation, otherwise review |
| Hook wiring that the substrate may never fire cannot be tested from inside the repo | #152 matcher finding | rule recorded in `docs/HANDOFF.md` §8; `docs/HOOK-EVENTS.md` (#152) is the inventory; no mechanism possible without driving the substrate — accepted |
| `15_a11y` reports `pass` on no HTML on this base | #154 | #154, fixed by #164 |

### 3.2 Vacuous-evidence risks

| Gap | Evidence | Tracks |
|---|---|---|
| A test that reads outside `src/`/`tests/` fails only inside mutmut's sandbox. `checks/ci/60_mutation.sh` lines 53–58 fail closed on 0 evaluated mutants (ADR-0022) and did so on #160 and #168; an earlier `docs/HANDOFF.md` §9 note called that a vacuous PASS and was corrected in commit `3cbacaf`. What remains: no regression test pins the guard, and the gate line shows a status without the mutant count, which is how the misreading happened | HANDOFF §9 rule 2 (corrected); `setup.cfg` `[mutmut]` ignore list is hand-kept | #187 (filed; re-scoped to a regression test for the existing guard plus the evaluated-mutant count in gate output and a `docs/CHECKS.md` note) |
| Integration tests that drive `verify.sh` are outside the mutation lane entirely, so a structurally vacuous one is invisible to any check | #150 blocker | #187 |
| Docs claim behaviour the code lacks; `55_doc_drift` and `56_critics` are dormant by choice until a judge is wired through the user's own agent | #151, #162, #165, #179; ADR-0030, `borromeanrings.toml` `[critic].judge_command = ""` | #68; `docs/CRITIC-ACTIVATION.md` |
| In-repo paths and links cited in docs do not resolve on the branch | #161, #168, #184, #170 | #188 (filed) |
| Re-authored ports carry copied phrases; the shingle comparison is a scratchpad script whose scope is whatever the reviewer opened | #181, #183, #185 blockers; the full-source sweep's eleven overlaps in #180, #182, #183, #184 after their reviews passed; HANDOFF §9 rule 1 | #189 (filed) |
| Presence-regex predicates (archetype features) can be read as correctness proofs | #179 should-fix | #79/#179 fix round (SPEC caveat) |
| Coverage non-regression row in `docs/ENFORCEMENT-COVERAGE.md` §A says ❌ while `40_test` ratchets coverage and `docs/CHECKS.md` (on `feat/self-description`, lands with #151) says so | the two documents disagree | unfiled as a separate issue: it is one row of #188's class; fix in the same PR that lands #188 |

### 3.3 Coverage of the matrices

| Gap | Evidence | Tracks |
|---|---|---|
| Matrices #2–#6 are documented with "enforced by" rows verified, but most rows beyond the existing checks are candidates | #153 review verified 19 claims; `docs/matrices/` (lands with #153) | #155 (fuzz/DAST), #156 (batch-size ratchet, deploy record), #157 (SLO/postmortem presence), #158 (PII fixtures, model staleness), #159 (static a11y rules) |
| Archetypes declare which checks must be non-`noop`; only the first catalogue exists | ADR-0062 (#179) | #79 |
| Python only; the check contract is language-neutral but no second set exists | `checks/python/` is the only language directory; ADR-0015 | #67 |
| Supply-chain rows that need CI or a remote service are deferred with exact configs, unapplied | ADR-0061 "Deferred to the maintainer" (on `feat/supply-chain`, #170) | #58 (maintainer items), #74 |
| API-usage contracts cover Python AST only; behavioural or type-aware API breaks are signature-shape only | ADR-0054 (#160); `docs/ENFORCEMENT-COVERAGE.md` §D | #130 (fix round), #140 for the formal end |

### 3.4 Ergonomics

| Gap | Evidence | Tracks |
|---|---|---|
| Parallel heavy lanes starve the fast gate's per-check timeout | `docs/HANDOFF.md` §9 rule 3 (300 s tripped under four mutation runs) | #144 |
| The heavy lane is the bar but the fast lane is what an agent runs by reflex; three PRs went red in CI after a green fast lane | `docs/HANDOFF.md` §2 item 1 | rule only (HANDOFF §2, `CHARTER.toml` `done_when` on #180); no mechanism proposed — a Stop hook cannot run mutation |
| Plugin symlinks break on non-symlink checkouts | #166 should-fix | #136 (fix round) |
| The legacy-config deprecation is visible only from `verify.sh` | #165 | fixed in #165's fix round |
| Self-status reads `MANUAL` for plugin-only governance | ADR-0057 "one honest gap" (on `feat/claude-plugin`, #166) | #136 |

## 4. Prioritised improvements

At most ten; each cites §2. No dates, no estimates, no targets.

1. **Share the fail-closed enumeration idiom** as one helper every file-listing check
   uses, with adversarial rows for git failure and non-repo per check. Because the same
   fail-open shape appeared in three PRs (#164, #148, #179) and was fixed by copy-paste each
   time. — #186
2. **Pin the mutation lane's fail-closed guard with a regression test and print the
   evaluated-mutant count on the gate line.** Because the guard held on #160/#168 yet the
   handoff document recorded the opposite for a full session (corrected in `3cbacaf`): a
   status without a count invites exactly that misreading, and nothing tests the guard. — #187
3. **Add a deterministic citation check** for in-repo links and paths in docs. Because dead
   citations are four of the thirteen doc-overclaim findings and need no model to catch. — #188
4. **Commit the shingle comparison as a heavy-lane check** for declared re-authored
   sources. Because all six 4D ports (#180–#185) carried copied passages at some pass, and
   the full-source sweep found eleven overlaps in four PRs that per-PR reviews running the
   same script had cleared — the strongest single piece of evidence in §2 that a review
   cannot substitute for a check with a declared scope. — #189
5. **Apply server-side branch protection with `enforce_admins`** so the text guard is a
   convenience, not the enforcement. Because #169 showed a one-line alias defeats the local
   guard, and the platform's own doctrine is that a local aid needs a backstop
   (`pre_bash_guard.sh` header). — #60
6. **Assert the count, not just the shape, in detector tests.** Because #160's existing test
   contained the exact nesting that double-counted and passed anyway; #182's single-line test
   passed while the multi-line case failed. Record it as a `docs/HANDOFF.md` §2 rule and a
   review-checklist line in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (#161). — #161 fix round
7. **Wire the doc-drift critic through the user's own agent on the heavy lane**, advisory
   first. Because the semantic half of the doc-overclaim class (#151, #162, #179) is the one
   class no deterministic check can reach, and the seam already exists dormant
   (ADR-0030). — #68
8. **Land the archetype non-`noop` clause on every governed project** so a hollow green is
   red by declaration. Because ADR-0049's incident and #164 both show `noop` reads as green
   unless something says which checks must not be `noop`. — #79
9. **Reconcile the two coverage documents** (`ENFORCEMENT-COVERAGE.md` §A vs `CHECKS.md` on `feat/self-description` (#151) on
   the coverage row; the ❌/✅ contradiction #170 found) in the PR that lands #188, and let
   that check keep them honest. — #188
10. **Bound every subprocess a hook starts** with the same `borromeanrings_bounded` wrapper
    the gate uses. Because #167 found an unbounded transcript read in the Stop hook, and a
    stalled Stop hook is a governance outage the user cannot see. — #81 fix round

## 5. Constraints honoured

| Rule | Where it is enforced or recorded |
|---|---|
| **No API keys, no independent model calls, no token spend outside the user's agent** | ADR-0030 (critic must run through the user's own `claude`); `borromeanrings.toml` `[critic].judge_command = ""` (dormant by default); `docs/research/AGENT-TOOLING-SURVEY.md` §0 (on `feat/prior-art-gate`) records this as the constraint that disqualified most of the tooling ecosystem; `docs/HANDOFF.md` §3 "Agent-only"; `CHARTER.toml` `may_not` and `stop_when` (lands with #180) |
| **No publishing, no push, no merge, no release without the maintainer's go** | `docs/HANDOFF.md` §3 "Draft before push" and §4 (never `--admin`); ADR-0007 (merge only on explicit invocation and a green gate); ADR-0057 §5 (on `feat/claude-plugin`, lands with #166): the marketplace file is a file in this repo, not a submission to any catalogue; ADR-0061 "Deferred to the maintainer" (on `feat/supply-chain`, lands with #170): Dependabot, SLSA and pinned-Actions configs are written into the ADR, not applied |
| **No CI growth, no packaging pipeline** | ADR-0061 Context (on `feat/supply-chain`, #170; the maintainer's constraint verbatim); #170's review confirmed `.github/workflows/` untouched; ADR-0013 defers pip packaging |
| **Threshold-free** | `docs/HANDOFF.md` §3 "Threshold-free"; `src/meta_harness/ratchet.py` (non-regression only); ADR-0022 (mutation is a ratchet, not a score); #153's review grepped the matrices for numeric targets and found none; `CHARTER.toml` `may_not` "introduce an arbitrary numeric quality target" (#180) |
| **Local guard on destructive and identity-breaking commands** | `.claude/hooks/pre_bash_guard.sh`: `rm -rf /`, fork bomb, `git reset --hard`, `DROP TABLE`, bare force-push, commit/push on a protected branch, wrong identity (ADR-0017/0019/0021); the guard is defence in depth, `06_git_identity` and #60 are the backstops |
| **Re-author, never copy, CC BY-NC-SA material** | ADR-0020; epic #172; `docs/HANDOFF.md` §9 rule 1; `CHARTER.toml` `stop_when` (#180); mechanism proposed in #189 |
| **Per-project opt-in; hooks inert elsewhere** | ADR-0013; every hook opens with `[ -f "$PROJECT_DIR/borromeanrings.toml" ] || exit 0`; #166's review verified all six (the plugin packaging, ADR-0057, is on `feat/claude-plugin`) |
| **Never touch user-level configuration from a task worktree** | `docs/HANDOFF.md` §3; `CHARTER.toml` `may_not` (#180); #150's review diffed `~/.claude/settings.json` before and after the suite to prove it |
