# ADR-0020 — Adopt the AI Fluency 4D framework as borromeanRings's collaboration vocabulary (re-authored under Apache-2.0)

**Status:** Accepted

## Context
borromeanRings already mechanizes a set of human↔agent collaboration disciplines without
naming them: the gate is automated evaluation of an agent's output, the prompt-rewrite hook
is enforced clarification of intent, and `merge.sh` is a human-vouched release boundary.
Anthropic's **AI Fluency** framework (Rick Dakan, Joseph Feller, Anthropic) gives these a
precise, externally-recognized vocabulary — the **4Ds**: Delegation, Description, Discernment,
Diligence — plus a proposed 5th, **Stewardship** (real-time governance of an autonomous run).
A set of skill notes distilled from that course was offered for inclusion.

Two problems blocked dropping those notes in directly:
1. **License.** The AI Fluency framework is **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** (NonCommercial + ShareAlike).
   Copying its *expression* into this Apache-2.0 repo would be incompatible: ShareAlike would
   force the copied files to stay CC-licensed, and NonCommercial conflicts with permissive OSS.
2. **Accuracy & fit.** The notes misdescribed the current gate (e.g. "6 checks" — it is 8),
   referenced config that does not exist (`[hooks]`, `[post_task]`, `[post_session]`,
   `[diligence]` blocks; hooks actually live in `.claude/settings.json`), used the old
   filename `borromeo.toml`, and carried personal/portfolio material out of scope for a
   public meta-harness repo.

## Decision
Adopt the 4D (+Stewardship) vocabulary as borromeanRings's collaboration framing, and
**re-author it in our own words** rather than port the source text. Ideas and methods are not
copyrightable — only their expression is — so original text describing the same ideas is ours
to license **Apache-2.0** with the rest of the repo. The AI Fluency framework is credited as
prior art (Dakan, Feller, Anthropic) in `NOTICE` and at the top of `docs/AI-FLUENCY.md`.

Concretely (see `docs/specs/SPEC-ai-fluency.md`): one philosophy doc (`docs/AI-FLUENCY.md`,
linked from `MANIFESTO.md`) mapping the 4Ds onto borromeanRings's existing mechanisms, and
five user-level skills under `skills/` — `ai-fluency-stewardship`, `-discernment`,
`-delegation`, `-prompting`, `-diligence`. Every borromeanRings reference is verified against
the live schema; no fictional config ships.

## Alternatives considered
- **Port the notes verbatim (or lightly edited) under a CC carve-out** — rejected: introduces
  a second, NonCommercial license into an otherwise Apache-2.0 public repo (a redistribution
  and contribution hazard), and would still carry the factual errors and personal content.
- **Skip the framing entirely; keep the mechanisms unnamed** — rejected: the vocabulary is
  genuinely clarifying for contributors and costs little; naming what the gate *is* strengthens
  the project's own thesis.
- **Mechanize Stewardship now (a tripwire check/hook)** — deferred, not rejected: the
  Stewardship *skill* ships as guidance; turning its tripwires into a gated check is follow-up
  work folded into the collaboration-governance Tier C effort and the pending hook-hang fix.

## Consequences
- (+) The repo gains a principled, externally-recognized vocabulary for what it already does,
  as clean Apache-2.0 text with proper attribution — no license conflict.
- (+) Re-authoring removes all personal/conversational content and corrects every schema
  inaccuracy *by construction*; the skills describe the real gate (8 checks), real hook
  location (`.claude/settings.json`), and real filename (`borromeanrings.toml`).
- (+) Skills install user-level via `install-global.sh`, available in any governed workspace —
  consistent with `borromeanrings` / `borromeanrings-contribute`.
- (−) The framing is borrowed; borromeanRings does not own the 4D concept and must keep its
  attribution intact (NOTICE + doc header).
- (−) Five new skills are surface to maintain; kept small and consolidated (13 source files →
  5 skills + 1 doc) to limit that cost.

## Amendment (2026-09-09, #177) — the fifth D withdrawn: Stewardship is a schedule over the four

**Status of the amendment:** Accepted. Supersedes every "fifth competency" / "5th D" phrasing
in this repo's docs and skills.

### Context
The original decision above adopted "the 4Ds plus a proposed 5th, Stewardship". Two facts
have since surfaced.

1. **Attribution.** The AI Fluency framework has exactly four competencies. Neither
   "Stewardship" nor a fifth competency appears anywhere in its published material. The
   idea of governing a run in motion is this repo's own extension; describing it as
   "proposed" by the framework attributed a position to its authors that they never took.
   Whatever the structural answer, that wording had to go.
2. **A sibling project's argument** (the maintainer's 4D project, ADR-0004 there; read for the
   argument only and re-authored here under the license rule of the decision above) is that
   every question Stewardship asks is one of the existing four asked at a different moment.

### The case for a fifth competency (this repo's original reason)
Delegation, Description, Discernment and Diligence read as *before-and-after* disciplines:
scope, specify, then judge and vouch. An agent running unattended for an hour is neither
before nor after; someone has to decide, in real time, whether it keeps going. That
"continue / interrupt / stop" decision felt like a distinct skill — one the gate had the seed
of (bounded Stop-gate retry, ADR-0016) and the skill catalogue lacked a name for.

### The case for a cadence (the sibling's argument, re-authored)
Take Stewardship's three questions apart:
- *Is the agent still inside what it was authorized to do?* — that is Delegation, re-checked
  mid-run against the written scope (`CHARTER.toml`).
- *Is the trajectory coherent — progressing rather than looping?* — that is Discernment's
  process half, brought forward from the end of the task to the middle of it.
- *Let it run, pause it, or pull the plug?* — that is Diligence: the human owning the next
  move and its consequences.

Each of the interrupt conditions this repo already wires lands in one of the four as well.
When the guard refuses a destructive command, the judgment being exercised is Diligence.
When the Stop hook escalates after its bounded retries, or a turn ends with nothing a
reviewer could inspect, the failure is one of process, which is Discernment's second half.
When an agent reaches for the gate's own logic, it has crossed the line the delegation
drew. None of these asks for a judgment the four do not already cover; the only novelty is
the moment at which it is made. A discipline exercised only at intervals is a schedule, not
a skill. The framework's own teaching already sorts the four by tempo — one pair sets
direction (Delegation, Diligence), the other runs turn by turn (Description, Discernment) —
so a "during" tempo sits on an axis the framework already draws, and no competency need be
added to a framework whose very name counts them.

### Decision
**Stewardship is a cadence over the four competencies.** The four stay as they are; the
stewardship skill becomes the schedule on which they are re-run during an autonomous run:

- **Two speeds** — *fast* (per turn: intent read as intended, an assumption stated, nothing
  in `may_not` touched) and *full* (per task: re-read the charter, read the receipts, test
  each `done_when` predicate, run the trajectory audit).
- **Checkpoints with detectors** — a checkpoint fires only when a mechanism in this repo can
  detect its trigger: the Stop verdict flipping (`stop_gate.sh`, persisted verdict + history),
  three failed Stops (the hook's bounded retry escalation), a `stop_when` condition holding
  (`22_charter` validates and prints the list every run), compaction or resume (PreCompact
  snapshot + SessionStart brief, ADR-0053), a stakes or scope change (the committed
  `CHARTER.toml` diff; `22_charter` refuses `high` without its extras), and a missed rewrite
  contract (the Stop-time record, ADR-0059 — on branch `feat/rewrite-contract` until merged).
- **Back-edges** — a *product* failure at a checkpoint returns the work to Description; a
  *process* failure returns it to Delegation. Re-running the same step without taking the
  back-edge fixes the wrong layer.

### Consequences
- `docs/AI-FLUENCY.md`: Stewardship moves out of the competency list into a **Cadence**
  section; the intro no longer says "plus a fifth"; the mapping table names the detectors.
- `skills/ai-fluency-stewardship/SKILL.md` is rewritten as the cadence (canonical file;
  `install-global.sh` templates it, and the plugin branch symlinks only `.claude/skills/`
  — one source of truth). Growth was paid for by trims in the same file (context budget).
- `docs/specs/SPEC-ai-fluency.md`, `docs/MANIFESTO.md`: "4Ds plus a 5th" wording corrected.
- The attribution defect is closed: the extension is stated as this repo's own.
- Mechanizing the remaining tripwires (retry-loop, orphaned process) stays Tier C follow-up
  (`docs/specs/SPEC-collaboration.md`); this amendment changes docs and skill text only.
- **Revisit if** some mid-run duty turns up that none of Delegation, Discernment or
  Diligence can absorb. That would be the first real evidence that a fifth competency exists, and
  the right response is to reopen this amendment, not to force the duty into the nearest D.
