# Architecture Decision Records

> CS130 (Part 1 L4 / Part 4): an ADR is the organizational memory of a load-bearing decision —
> context, the alternatives considered, the choice, and its consequences — so the decision can be
> revisited later instead of silently re-litigated. borromeanRings records these because its own thesis
> is auditable, evidence-backed engineering: it would be hypocritical to make these choices without
> a trail.

Open items live in [`../DELAYED-DECISIONS.md`](../DELAYED-DECISIONS.md); a delayed decision
graduates to an ADR once the Maintainer resolves it.
