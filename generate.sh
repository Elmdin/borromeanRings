# borromeanRings generate — the `headless` GENERATOR ADAPTER (SPEC-generator.md §3.2).
#
# Drives the same generate -> gate -> retry -> escalate loop the Stop hook drives, but
# with a scripted generator instead of an agent and with no substrate underneath: it
# runs `[generator].command` from the governed project's borromeanrings.toml, decides
# what happens next, and runs the gate itself. That makes the loop testable end to end
# (#202) and drivable without a Stop hook (#144).
#
# Usage:  ./generate.sh [--heavy] [project_path]
#   project_path defaults to $BORROMEANRINGS_PROJECT / $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR / $PWD.
#   --heavy gates each attempt with the CI-tier lane (same as BORROMEANRINGS_HEAVY=1).
#
# Environment:
#   BORROMEANRINGS_RUN_KEY            attempt-counter key (default "headless"); two keys
#                                     in one project keep independent counters.
#   BORROMEANRINGS_GENERATOR_TIMEOUT  wall-clock bound per generator invocation (540 s).
#   BORROMEANRINGS_GATE_TIMEOUT       wall-clock bound per gate run (540 s).
#                                     Both bounds need coreutils `timeout` (or `gtimeout`)
#                                     on PATH; without it the driver says so and runs
#                                     UNBOUNDED, because refusing to run at all would be
#                                     worse on a host that simply lacks it.
#
# Exit codes:  0 green · 1 escalated (the human takes over) · 2 generator-failed
#              3 refused (nothing to drive: no borromeanrings.toml, no [generator].command)
#              4 misconfigured (a config IS here and it is broken — a governed project
#                that would otherwise go ungated and unnoticed; deliberately NOT 3, which
#                an orchestrator may reasonably read as "skip this worktree").
# Refusal is pre-flight only: once an attempt is under way, any failure that stops the
# driver escalates instead (ADR-0078).
#
# The command is invoked as `<command> <project_path> <last_verdict_path|"">` with
# BORROMEANRINGS_{FAILING_CHECKS,ATTEMPT,CAP,GENERATOR} in the environment, cwd at the
# project, stdin closed and output captured. What it may NOT do is the point: it must
# not run the gate itself (a self-run gate is a self-report — ADR-0049), must not write
# under .meta-harness/ (enforced here, not requested), must not push, and cannot reset or
# raise the retry bound — the counter is one anchor for it, the gate's append-only verdict
# history is the other, and the higher of the two wins. CAP and the decision live in meta_harness.generator, shared with
# .claude/hooks/stop_gate.sh so the two adapters cannot drift.
#
# See docs/specs/SPEC-generator.md, ADR-0071 and ADR-0078.

# A CORRECTION to SPEC-generator.md N3 — twice over. N3 said the driver compares the
# dirty-tree OID; the tree is not enough, and neither is `(branch, head, tree)`:
#
#   * HEAD is not the only ref a check reads. 06_git_identity, 09_commits, 11_changelog,
#     13_adr and 34_api_diff each resolve a base by trying `origin/dev dev origin/main
#     main`, so `git update-ref refs/heads/main HEAD` — or a fetch — moves what five
#     checks diff against while HEAD, the branch and the tree stay byte-identical.
#   * The index is not the working tree. 01_source_coherence, 12_secrets and 15_a11y
#     enumerate files with `git ls-files`, so `git rm --cached f` changes what three
#     checks look at while the file sits unchanged on disk and `add -A` re-adds it.
#
# Under a narrower comparison a generator that fixes any of those is told it did nothing
# and the run escalates with the fix already in place.
#
# SCOPE, because this list has been narrowed and corrected three times and the honest move
# is to say what it covers rather than to keep adding to it: these five facts are a GIT
# identity. They cover everything the gate reads that git can see and does not ignore.
# Outside them, by construction: gitignored paths (this repo ignores `mutants/`,
# `.mutmut-cache`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.venv/`, which 60_mutation and 40_test read —
# `.meta-harness/` is the one exception, force-excluded above AND separately guarded), and
# ambient machine state (installed packages and binaries on PATH, which 70_pip_audit,
# 72_licenses, 40_test and 60_mutation read). A generator that pip-installs a package or
# shadows a binary changes five checks' verdicts with all five facts byte-identical. That
# residue belongs to an executor the generator cannot reach (#145), not to a comparison.
