# borromeanRings merge — gate-gated, explicitly-invoked merge of the current branch
# into a base branch (default: main).
#
# It executes a human's merge decision; it never originates one. A merge happens
# only if (a) you ran this command AND (b) ./verify.sh exits 0 (fail-closed).
#
# Usage:  ./merge.sh [--auto] [base]      (base defaults to main)
#   default : run the local gate, then merge immediately.
#   --auto  : run the local gate, then WAIT for the PR's CI checks to pass, then
#             merge. Still explicitly invoked per-merge — there is no standing,
#             unattended auto-merge mode (that would be self-rewriting, forbidden).
#             Used because server-side required checks need a paid plan on a
#             private repo; borromeanRings orchestrates the wait itself. See ADR-0009.
#
# Policy is in meta_harness.merge_policy; this is the plumbing.
# See docs/specs/SPEC-merge.md and docs/adr/{0007,0009}-*.md.
