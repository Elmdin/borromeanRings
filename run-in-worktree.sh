# borromeanRings — the `worktree` executor: run the gate against a SNAPSHOT of this
# project, in a throwaway git worktree, and bring the receipts back.
#
# Why a separate entry point and not a flag on verify.sh: verify.sh is the gate every
# hook, CI job and governed project already invokes; a new code path inside it can
# regress the default path, and the default path's job is to be boring. This script
# is a caller OF verify.sh — it prepares a tree, runs the unmodified gate there, and
# copies the bundle back. `local` (plain ./verify.sh) is untouched by construction.
# See docs/adr/0076-worktree-executor.md and SPEC-executor.md (lands with #203).
#
# What it gives you (the SPEC's guarantees, in this script's terms):
#   * snapshot   — HEAD + the dirty tree (tracked edits AND untracked-not-ignored
#                  files) + the REF STATE at capture time; ignored paths
#                  (.meta-harness/, mutants/, caches, venvs) are NOT materialised;
#   * G8         — `git rev-parse HEAD` and `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` inside
#                  the worktree equal the primary's (asserted at runtime, fail-closed)
#                  and CANNOT MOVE for the life of the run, whatever the primary does;
#   * isolation  — its own working tree, index, REF NAMESPACE, .meta-harness/,
#                  mutants/ and tool caches; it shares only the object store, and
#                  never commits, never writes a ref or reflog in the primary, never
#                  writes anything into the primary except the copied receipt bundle;
#   * cleanup    — the snapshot repo and its temp dir go away on every exit path
#                  (success, failure, interrupt), and the removal is bounded to the
#                  directory this run created.
#
# NOT a `git worktree`, and that is the point (PR #212 review; ADR-0076). A linked
# worktree shares the repository's REF namespace, so making `--abbrev-ref HEAD` equal
# the primary's branch means pointing HEAD at the primary's LIVE branch ref: it
# matches at the instant you assert it, and then silently follows the branch forward
# the moment the primary commits — while the materialised tree stays pinned at the
# captured snapshot. Checks that re-derive HEAD and their commit range live
# (09_commits, 13_adr, 11_changelog, 34_api_diff) then judge a range that does not
# correspond to the tree they are looking at. Instead this builds a fresh repository
# that BORROWS the object store (`objects/info/alternates` — no object is copied) and
# owns its refs: the primary's refs are copied in verbatim as a snapshot, and the
# branch is pinned there at the captured commit. Nothing outside the run can move it.

Usage: run-in-worktree.sh [--project DIR] [--heavy] [--keep]

  --project DIR  the governed project (default: $BORROMEANRINGS_PROJECT,
                 $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, then $PWD — the same resolution verify.sh uses)
  --heavy        pass --heavy through to the gate (CI-tier lane)
  --keep         do NOT remove the worktree; print its path for inspection

Prints `RECEIPTS: <dir>` (the bundle copied back into the project) and, with --keep,
`WORKTREE: <dir>`. Exits with the gate's own exit code.
