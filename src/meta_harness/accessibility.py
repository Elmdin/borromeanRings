"""Static accessibility (a11y) invariants for HTML — the Product/UX archetype slice.

A product's UX carries invariants no code check sees. This gates the *high-confidence,
deterministic* accessibility facts derivable from static HTML — the kind a screen-reader
user is blocked by and that need no rendering to detect.

Gated by default (matrix rows U1–U3):

- ``html_lang`` — a full document's ``<html>`` must declare a ``lang`` (WCAG 3.1.1);
  a screen reader can't pick a voice/pronunciation without it.
- ``img_alt`` — every ``<img>`` must carry an ``alt`` attribute (WCAG 1.1.1); empty
  ``alt=""`` is allowed for decorative images, but the attribute must be present.
- ``page_title`` — a full document must have a non-empty ``<title>`` (WCAG 2.4.2).

Available but **opt-in**, because a shipped frontend usually has a backlog against each
and a gate nobody can turn on governs nothing (rows U4–U6, ADR-0075):

- ``control_label`` — every labelable form control has an accessible name: a wrapping
  or ``for=``-associated ``<label>`` that has text, an ``aria-label``, or an
  ``aria-labelledby`` naming an element that has one (WCAG 3.3.2, 4.1.2).
- ``link_text`` — every ``<a href>`` has discernible text, from its own content or from
  a named descendant (``<img alt>``, ``aria-label``, an ``<svg><title>``) (WCAG 2.4.4).
- ``heading_structure`` — a full document has exactly one ``<h1>``, and no heading
  skips a level on the way down (WCAG 1.3.1).

Deliberately low-false-positive — contrast ratios, keyboard reachability, focus
visibility and target size are properties of the *rendered* page, not of the source, and
belong to a real a11y tool (axe-core) on an opt-in heavy lane (issue #210), not to a
deterministic static gate. Threshold-free: no arbitrary score target. Rules that
presuppose a full page (``html_lang``, ``page_title``, the "has an ``<h1>``" half of
``heading_structure``) apply only when an ``<html>`` tag is present, so HTML *fragments*
(components, partials) don't trip them. stdlib ``html.parser`` only; no dependency.

The tree is read the way a browser would build it, not the way the text looks:
duplicate attributes resolve **first-wins** (the HTML parsing spec); ``<script>`` and
``<style>`` content is source rather than text; the content of a ``<textarea>``,
``<title>``, ``<iframe>``, ``<xmp>``, ``<noembed>``, ``<noframes>`` or ``<plaintext>`` is
**text, not markup**, so an ``<img>`` written there is a string a browser shows and not
an image — and tag-shaped text stays text, so ``<title><b></b></title>`` has a title; a
``<template>`` is a stamp rather than a page and **no** rule judges what is inside one;
``hidden`` and ``aria-hidden`` take an element and its subtree out of the accessibility
tree, so **every rule that judges rendered content skips it** — including the outline,
because the sequence a screen reader navigates is the one with those headings gone;
``page_title`` and ``html_lang`` are unaffected, since a ``<title>`` and the ``<html>``
element are document metadata that ``hidden`` cannot remove; and inside an
``<svg>``/``<math>`` subtree a familiar tag name is **not** an HTML element (an
``<svg><title>`` names an icon, not the page), until an HTML integration point **of that
same language** — ``<foreignObject>`` in SVG, ``<mtext>`` in MathML — resumes HTML.

Where the source cannot answer honestly the module prefers a **missed violation to an
invented one**: a gate that fails correct markup is worse than no gate, because it gets
switched off. Every such choice is written down in the SPEC — including the two places
where the error still runs the *other* way (``<select>`` content, and ``<image>``), which
are named there as what they are rather than filed with the safe ones.

Names are **resolved, not merely present**: every element accumulates the text of its own
subtree plus the names contributed by descendants, so a reference or a wrapping
``<label>`` that resolves to *nothing* names nothing. The parse is a single
fact-gathering pass; each rule is then a pure function of those facts, so adding a rule
cannot perturb another. See docs/specs/SPEC-accessibility.md, ADR-0045 and ADR-0075.
