"""Adoption planner: upgrade an EXISTING governed project onto newer checks.

``init.sh`` bootstraps a *new* project; adoption plans the migration of an
existing one — which newer checks to add to ``[checks].required`` and which
ratchet baselines to seed from current state so the first gate run is green. A
ratchet added without a baseline is vacuous (its default is "off"); seeded from
the project's current value it holds the line going forward without ever
imposing an arbitrary target (the no-absolute-target principle). Pure planning
plus a scoped TOML rewrite live here; ``adopt.sh`` performs the filesystem
effects. See docs/specs/SPEC-adopt.md and ADR-0041.
