"""Dependency CVE audit — parse ``pip-audit`` JSON, fail on known vulnerabilities.

A dependency with a published CVE is a live security hole (matrix row **C —
dependency/CVE audit**). This is a **heavy** (CI-tier) check: ``pip-audit`` hits
the network and audits the whole installed closure, so it runs in CI's clean
environment (which contains exactly the project's declared deps), never on the
fast Stop gate.

The parse/decide logic here is pure (JSON in, findings out) and unit-tested; the
check script runs the tool. Base packaging tooling (``pip``/``setuptools``/
``wheel``) and explicitly-accepted CVEs are ignorable — they are the environment's
infrastructure, not the project's declared supply chain, and would otherwise make
the gate flap on CVEs the project can't act on. See docs/specs/SPEC-audit.md and
ADR-0034.

    ``scope`` is the project's own dependency closure (normalised names, from
    :mod:`meta_harness.closure`). pip-audit reports on the whole *installed*
    environment, which on a CI runner happens to be the project's dependencies and
    on a developer machine is everything they have ever installed. Without a scope
    the same commit gets a different verdict per machine, and the remedy the check
    prints — add it to ``[audit].ignore_vulns`` — is actionable and **wrong** for a

    callers that have already narrowed the report.
