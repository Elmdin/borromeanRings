"""The project's own dependency closure — what a supply-chain check may judge (#228).

``70_pip_audit`` and ``72_licenses`` read the *installed* environment. On a clean CI
runner that happens to equal the project's declared dependencies, and both checks'
comments said so — ``in CI that is the project's declared deps``. Off CI it is false,
and nothing detected the difference: on a developer machine the audit reported 43
CVE'd and 14 GPL packages — torch, notebook, semgrep, pynput — none of them
dependencies of anything being gated.

That breaks the claim ``verify.yml`` makes in its own header: the same ``verify.sh``,
author- and environment-agnostic (QAS-2). Same commit, different verdict, decided by
what else happens to be installed. And the remedy each check printed was *actionable
and wrong*: following it would write a permanent exception into the project's config
for a package it does not depend on.

This module answers "which distributions is this project actually responsible for?"
— the declared dependencies plus everything they pull in — so the checks can judge
that set and say so. Pure stdlib: the declarations come from ``pyproject.toml``, the
edges from installed metadata (``importlib.metadata``).

**When in doubt, include.** For a security check a false inclusion costs a look while
a false exclusion costs the finding, so every ambiguity resolves toward including:

* Environment markers are not evaluated — a package that might not be needed on *this*
  platform is still listed.
* A requirement guarded **solely** by an extra nobody asked for is skipped. Following
  all of them turns a dependency graph into the whole index (measured: 624
  distributions against 55 for the real closure, including ``notebook``).
* But an extra the project **did** ask for is followed. ``pip-audit[doc]`` in the
  manifest means ``pdoc`` is this project's dependency, and a CVE in it is this
  project's problem. Requested extras are tracked per distribution rather than
  stripped off the name.
* And a marker that could be satisfied *without* the extra (``extra == "x" or
  sys_platform == "win32"``) is followed too, because presence of the word ``extra``
  is not proof the requirement is optional.
