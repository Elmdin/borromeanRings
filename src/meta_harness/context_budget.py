"""Context budget: measure what borromeanRings itself puts into the agent's context.

Governance is not free — every hook line, skill file and directive the harness
injects is paid for on every turn. This module measures that always-loaded weight
so ``19_context_budget`` can **ratchet** it: the total may not regress above the
recorded baseline, and there is no absolute target (the project's stance against
number gates). Sources, per governed project root:

* ``directive`` — the UserPromptSubmit prompt-rewrite directive text (injected on
  **every prompt**; passed in by the caller, built from the project's ``[context]``).
* ``instructions`` — ``CLAUDE.md`` / ``AGENTS.md`` at the project root (loaded once
  per session by the wrapped agent).
* ``skill`` — every ``skills/*/SKILL.md`` and ``.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`` (the
  frontmatter is always loaded; the body on invocation — the whole file is counted
  as the upper bound).
* ``hook`` — the static message templates a hook script can emit to the agent:
  the quoted literal on every line of ``.claude/hooks/*.sh`` whose first word is
  ``echo``, ``printf`` or ``deny`` (the PreToolUse guard's helper, which wraps its
  argument as ``permissionDecisionReason``). Messages composed at run time
  (``deny "$reason"``, the gate's verdict text) are out of scope — see the SPEC.

Tokens are **approximated as bytes / 4, rounded up** (``BYTES_PER_TOKEN``): the
common English-prose rule of thumb, deliberately chosen over a tokenizer dependency
— a ratchet only needs a *consistent* measure, not an exact one. Pure stdlib; the
only I/O is reading the files it reports on. See docs/specs/SPEC-context-budget.md
and ADR-0055.
