"""Agent-enhancement recommender — surface open-source tools that improve the
**wrapped AI itself**, not the code it writes.

borromeanRings's founding stance is "enhance the wrapped agent; the agent performs."
Beyond prompt-rewriting and steered research, a governed project benefits from a
curated capability layer: model routers, MCP servers, observability, caching. This
is the advisory selector for that layer — a sibling of the project profiler
(identify interests → recommend tools → hint at integration). **Advisory, never a
gate**: it proposes; the human decides and wires.

The catalog is **curated and health-audited** — it is not an authoritative or
exhaustive index. Every entry carries the evidence a recommendation rests on: the
source URL (never a search query), the date its maintenance was last verified, whether
it needs an API key, and which substrates it can actually serve. A tool that only acts
on API-key traffic is never offered to a subscription agent CLI that exposes none —
that recommendation would send the user somewhere they cannot go. Unverified entries
are marked so a recommendation never asserts more certainty than it has (correctness
first). Audit sources: docs/research/AGENT-TOOLING-SURVEY.md (2026-09-02).
See docs/specs/SPEC-enhancements.md, ADR-0037, and #133.
