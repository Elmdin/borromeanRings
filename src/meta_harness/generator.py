"""The generator loop's decision core — who produces the next change, bounded.

borromeanRings drives one loop: *generate → gate → retry → escalate*. Two adapters sit
in the generator's seat — the Stop-hooked agent (``.claude/hooks/stop_gate.sh``) and the
headless driver (``generate.sh``) — and the loop's rules must not be a property of
either script. This module is where they live:

* :data:`CAP` — the retry bound, declared **once** and read by both adapters, so no
  adapter can quietly grant itself a fourth attempt;
* :func:`next_action` — the whole decision, pure: no clock, no filesystem, no
  subprocess. Given what the generator did and what the gate said, it returns what
  happens next. Ambiguous counts raise rather than resolve themselves into a pass;
* :func:`read_generator` — the self-declared provenance label (ADR-0071 §4). Absent
  means ``""``, never a guess: the gate records who claimed to write the change and
  makes **no decision** on it (ADR-0049: the generator's word is not evidence);
* :func:`failing_check_ids` — the retry request's check names, read off the verdict's
  own rows so a summary-format change can never silently drop one;
* :func:`snapshot_evidence` / :func:`evidence_writes` — the driver's proof that the
  generator did not write under ``.meta-harness/``. The attempt counter lives there,
  and an unbounded retry loop is the one failure a human cannot un-spend.

What is deliberately NOT here: running the generator, running the gate, the clock and
the attempt counter's file. Those are the thin shell drivers' (``generate.sh``,
``stop_gate.sh``). See docs/specs/SPEC-generator.md and ADR-0071/ADR-0078.

    """What the loop does next, from what just happened. Pure.

    The order of the rules *is* the contract, and each one outranks everything below it:

    1. a non-zero ``exit_code`` is the generator saying it could not (N4) — no gate
       result and no remaining attempt can redeem it;
    2. exit 0 with an unchanged tree is the generator saying it *would* not; retrying an
       idempotent generator only spends attempts, so escalate now (N4);
    3. a green gate ends the loop, on the last attempt as much as the first;
    4. at or beyond the cap, the human takes over (N5);
    5. otherwise, retry.

    ``gate_ok`` is read only once rules 1 and 2 have passed, so a driver that skipped the
    gate (because it had nothing to gate) may pass anything for it.

    Args:
        attempt: 1-based attempt number just completed.
        cap: the retry bound for this run — :data:`CAP` for both shipped adapters.
        gate_ok: did the gate pass? Ignored unless the generator wrote a change.
        tree_changed: did the generator change the working tree?
        exit_code: the generator command's exit status (0 = it says it wrote a change).

    Returns:

    Raises:
        ValueError: if ``attempt`` or ``cap`` is below 1. An impossible count is an

    the tamper it exists to catch. Hashing costs a read of the evidence area per attempt

    Nothing is excluded, and nothing is skipped for being the wrong kind of file. The
