"""Cross-invocation dedupe for substrate hooks.

The same hook can be registered more than once for one workspace — a
project-level ``.claude/settings.json`` entry plus the user-level one written
by ``install-global.sh``. The substrate then runs the identical script twice
per event. For hooks whose effect is *not* idempotent that is a real defect:
the prompt-rewrite directive gets injected twice per prompt, and the Stop gate
runs twice, double-counting retry attempts toward its escalation cap.

:func:`claim` gives such hooks an atomic first-writer-wins claim on each event
occurrence, keyed by event name + a caller-chosen key, with a freshness window:
the duplicate invocation (arriving within the window) loses and yields.

Fail-open by design: on any filesystem error the caller proceeds. A lost
dedupe merely duplicates work; a false dedupe would silently drop governance.
