"""The FAST (interactive) lane — which verification runs while you are still working.

borromeanRings ran one lane on every Stop: the whole required set, including the whole
test suite. On this repo that is 445 s of wall clock, 404 s of it ``40_test``, before the
agent may say it is finished (#226). The verification was not wrong, only mis-placed: a
full suite belongs on the pre-merge/CI path, where no one is waiting on it.

So there are three lanes, declared in config and never hardcoded:

``fast``
    The interactive lane the Stop hook runs (``verify.sh --fast``). Every required check
    runs; only ``40_test`` narrows, to the paths the project declares in
    ``[test].fast_paths``. A project that declares none has no fast lane and behaves
    exactly as it did before.
``full`` (the default)
    ``./verify.sh`` — every required check over everything.
``heavy``
    ``./verify.sh --heavy`` — full, plus the CI-tier checks (ADR-0033). ``--heavy``
    always implies the full lane; a "fast heavy" run would be a contradiction.

This module is the one place that knows what "fast" means, so the shell checks only ask
it a question. It is a leaf: it reads :class:`~meta_harness.spine.Config` and nothing else.

The honesty rule this module exists to keep: a fast-lane pass must never be readable as a
full-lane pass. :data:`FAST_LANE_NOTE` names what the lane did not run and where it is run
instead; it goes in the check's log, the receipt's ``summary``, and the gate's own output.
See ADR-0081 and docs/CHECKS.md.
