"""Effectiveness ledger — did governing this project actually catch anything, over time?

`status` answers "is it green *now*"; the ledger answers "has the gate *done anything*"
by summarising each project's append-only verdict history (:data:`~meta_harness.verdict.
VERDICT_HISTORY_FILE`, written by ``verify.sh`` every run): how many times it ran, how
many of those runs it **caught a failure** (the evidence the gate is load-bearing, not
decorative), the current pass/fail streak, and how many runs carry per-check evidence
(ADR-0056 — a run recorded before evidence capture proves less than one that shows what
happened). A project with many runs and zero
failures ever is either genuinely clean or under-tested; one that has caught failures is
demonstrably doing work. Threshold-free — counts and a streak, no score.

Pure summary (:func:`summarize_history`) + rendering, with the filesystem walk delegated
to :func:`~meta_harness.status.discover_projects`. See docs/specs/SPEC-ledger.md and
ADR-0047.
