"""Dependency license compliance — parse ``pip-licenses`` JSON, deny incompatible
licenses.

A copyleft (GPL/AGPL/SSPL) dependency can force the whole project's license
(matrix row **C — license compliance**). This is a **heavy** (CI-tier) check: it
reads the installed closure, so it runs in CI's clean environment.

Denylist, not allowlist: license *strings* vary wildly ("MIT" vs "MIT License"
vs "Expat"), so enumerating every acceptable spelling is brittle. Instead the
project declares the handful of **incompatible** patterns to reject
(`[licenses].deny`, case-insensitive substring), with `allow_packages` for
vetted exceptions. Pure parse/decide here; the check script runs the tool. See
docs/specs/SPEC-licenses.md and ADR-0035.
