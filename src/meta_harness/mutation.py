"""Mutation testing — parse mutmut's result counts and compute a score.

Mutation testing measures *oracle/assertion strength*, not mere execution:
coverage tells you a line ran; mutation tells you a test would have **caught** a
change to it. This is borromeanRings's answer to the coverage-Goodhart trap (a
100%-coverage suite with vacuous assertions kills no mutants). The score feeds
the T1 :mod:`meta_harness.ratchet` so it may not regress. Run as a CI-tier heavy
check (mutation runs the suite once per mutant — too slow for the inner gate);
see checks/ci/60_mutation.sh and ADR-0022.

Only the parsing + score math live here (deterministic, unit-tested); invoking
mutmut is the shell check's job (the tool is a module secret).
