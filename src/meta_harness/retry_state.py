"""Where the Stop hook keeps its retry count: outside the governed tree.

The Stop hook bounds the generate -> verify -> retry loop: after ``cap`` failed
gates it stops blocking and hands control to the human. That bound is only as
good as the count behind it. It used to live at
``<project>/.meta-harness/stop_attempts/<session>``, inside the tree the agent
works in, and a missing file read as ``0`` — so one ``rm`` bought unlimited
attempts (#218).

The count now lives under ``$XDG_STATE_HOME/borromeanrings/<digest>/`` (default
``~/.local/state``), where ``<digest>`` names the project by its resolved
absolute path (ADR-0079). What that buys, stated at its true size:

- Resistance to **accident** and to a **naive reset**: tidying ``.meta-harness/``,
  deleting the old counter or writing ``0`` into it no longer resets the count.
- **Failing closed**: when the count cannot be located, read or written, the
  verdict is ``unrecorded`` and the hook escalates to the human at once, where
  the old hook silently counted from zero.
- It is **not a bound against intent**. Anything running as the user can write
  the state directory, and that includes the agent's own code once the gate
  runs it: the gate executes the project's tests as the user, so a
  ``conftest.py`` can delete the count (#221 review, D3). Only a test run
  isolated from this state (another account, a privileged executor, a sandbox)
  closes that, and nothing in this module can.

Migration: a counter the pre-ADR-0079 hook left in the tree is read, merged
with ``max`` and then removed, reached without following any symlink. A
symlink anywhere on that path is refused as hostile (``unrecorded``): followed,
it let the migration delete the real count through the link (#221 review, D1).

Pure path derivation and decisions up top; the filesystem I/O below is thin and
the one impure input (path resolution) is injected. ``main`` is the hook's
entry point.
