"""Native secret scanning — high-confidence provider tokens and private keys.

A hard-coded credential must never land in the tree (matrix row **C — secret
scanning**). This is deliberately a **high-confidence, low-false-positive** scan:
only well-formed provider tokens and private-key blocks, whose shapes almost never
occur by accident. Generic "high-entropy string" / secret-named-assignment
heuristics — the noisy part — are left to a tool (gitleaks) on the CI heavy lane;
a T0 gate that cries wolf gets disabled. Native stdlib ``re``; no external tool.

See docs/specs/SPEC-secrets.md and ADR-0032.
