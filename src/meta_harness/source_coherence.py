"""Source-coherence guard: is the gate actually looking at the project's code?

A check that finds no source exits 0, and a bare exit code cannot distinguish the two
situations behind that zero:

* **greenfield** — there is no source anywhere yet, so "nothing to analyze" is the truth
  and the gate must stay green (ideation must never be forced to scaffold code);
* **misconfigured** — ``[project].src_dir`` points somewhere empty while the repository
  demonstrably holds source elsewhere. Every source-reading check then passes vacuously
  and the verdict reports a green that means nothing.

Scope, stated precisely because a guard that over-claims is worse than none: this decides
on **``src_dir`` only**. ``[project].package`` is a separate, legitimately-optional knob
that three checks additionally require; the calling check reports when it is unset rather
than failing, since a scripts-only project has no package. Whatever counts source here
must count it the way the protected checks do, or guard and checks drift apart.

This module is the pure decision core for that distinction: it takes already-gathered
counts and paths and returns a verdict, so it is trivially testable and holds no I/O.
Gathering (git vs filesystem) belongs to the calling check. See
docs/specs/SPEC-self-status.md and ADR-0049.
