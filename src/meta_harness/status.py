"""Portfolio status — the roster health view across every governed project.

borromeanRings governs invariants *inside* each repo; this is the missing view *across*
repos. It answers, in one table, the questions a maintainer running borromeanRings on
many projects otherwise has to ``cd`` around to learn: which projects are governed, how
many checks each enforces, whether its last gate was green, whether its config drifted
behind the recommended set, and whether it is even a git repo (history checks such as
``12_secrets`` fail closed when it is not).

This module does the filesystem/process reads (discover projects, query git, read each
project's persisted verdict) and delegates the judgement and rendering to the pure
:mod:`meta_harness.status_assess`. Keeping the I/O here and the logic there keeps both
focused and low-coupling — consistent with borromeanRings's architecture, where the bash
entrypoints (``verify.sh``, ``status.sh``) are the composition roots and the Python
modules stay narrow. Advisory, never a gate: the default read-only report always exits 0;
re-gating for freshness (``--run``) is orchestrated by ``status.sh``. See
docs/specs/SPEC-status.md and ADR-0046.
