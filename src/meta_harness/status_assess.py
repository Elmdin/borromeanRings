"""Project-status assessment & presentation — the pure core of the roster view.

Given already-gathered facts about one governed project, decide its health row
(:func:`build_status`) and render a roster of rows as a table (:func:`render`,
:func:`summarize`). Kept free of filesystem/process I/O so it is fully unit-testable;
:mod:`meta_harness.status` does the git/fs reads and calls in here.

It reuses the single sources of truth for the two things it judges: adoption drift via
``plan_adoption``/``RECOMMENDED`` (:mod:`meta_harness.adopt`) and the last gate outcome
via the persisted :class:`~meta_harness.verdict.Verdict`. See docs/specs/SPEC-status.md
and ADR-0046.

It serves BOTH scopes, because they are one responsibility at two granularities: the
roster view across projects, and the **self-status** view of a single project — is
borromeanRings governing me, is enforcement actually on, and was that green real? The
latter is the default report (ADR-0049); see docs/specs/SPEC-self-status.md.
