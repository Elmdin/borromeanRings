"""Toolchain determinism: the gate's verdict must not depend on which tool release ran.

ADR-0008 accepted lower-bound ranges for the check toolchain and deferred exact
pinning until "CI/local drift causes a problem". It did. On 2026-09-10 two pull
requests went red on GitHub while green locally, because ``pip install -e ".[dev]"``
resolved newer releases than the machine that produced them: ``ruff`` 0.16.7 against
0.15.8 reformatted a file, and ``mypy`` crossed a major version. A formatter's output
is not covered by semantic versioning, so an upper bound at the next major (the
``78_pins`` rule, ADR-0061) is necessary but *not sufficient* for a tool whose output
IS the verdict. Those tools need an exact pin.

This module is the pure core that compares the pins a repo *declares* against the
versions its gate *observes*. It performs no I/O: the caller supplies both the file
text and the observed versions, so every branch is testable without a subprocess.

One detail earns the ``Tool.invocation`` field. The checks do not agree on how they
reach their tool: ``10_format`` runs ``ruff`` from ``PATH`` while ``40_test`` runs
``python3 -m pytest``. On a machine with a user-site shim those resolve to *different
installs* of the same distribution, so a drift check that reads
``importlib.metadata`` alone can certify a version the gate never runs. Each tool is
therefore recorded with the argv the gate actually uses, and observation must mirror
it. See docs/adr/0077-pin-the-check-toolchain.md.
