"""Persisted gate verdicts — the last-known health signal a portfolio view reads.

The gate (``verify.sh``) computes a fail-closed verdict from receipts on every run,
but historically kept nothing durable beyond the per-check receipts and the
``last_green_state`` hash (:mod:`meta_harness.change_detect`). A cross-project status
view (:mod:`meta_harness.status`) needs one compact, readable answer per project:
*did the last gate pass, and on which checks?*

This module defines that record and its read/write. Written best-effort by the gate
(a write failure must never turn a real PASS into a FAIL) into the governed project's
evidence area (``.meta-harness/``, git-ignored — same home as receipts). Reads are
fail-soft: a missing, unreadable, or malformed record yields ``None``, never an
exception — a status view must degrade one row, not crash. This is a *last-known*
signal, not a re-verification; ``status --run`` re-gates for freshness. See
docs/specs/SPEC-status.md and ADR-0046.
