"""What a project gets by default from `init.sh`, exercised rather than assumed (#230).

A planted AWS secret access key passed the gate on a project set up by the real
`init.sh` — twice over. The pattern set did not cover it, and the default required
set did not include `12_secrets` at all, so even a covered credential would have
gone through. Both were invisible because every previous test wrote its own
`borromeanrings.toml` and therefore tested a config no new user ever gets.

These tests run the real `init.sh` and the real gate, and never write a config.
