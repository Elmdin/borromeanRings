"""Executor conformance: `worktree` must say exactly what `local` says.

`local` (plain `./verify.sh`) is the reference executor; `worktree`
(`./run-in-worktree.sh`, ADR-0076) is the second implementation of the same
contract. This test is what makes the contract real: it runs the **whole fast
lane** over one fixture project under both executors and compares the two receipt
bundles field by field, logs included, under the equivalence relation in
`meta_harness.executor` (SPEC-executor.md §5, lands with #203).

The fixture is built to *discriminate* — every property the worktree executor
could plausibly get wrong shows up as a receipt difference here:

* it sits on a `feat/` branch whose commit touches `src/`, so `08_branch` names the
  branch in its log and `13_adr` **fails**. A detached snapshot reports its branch as
  `HEAD`: `13_adr` would flip to pass and `08_branch`'s log would name `HEAD`. That
  is G8 — and the cases below prove the other half of it, that the branch identity
  cannot *drift* mid-run either.
* it has an uncommitted edit to a tracked file *and* an untracked file, each with
  its own lint error, so `20_lint`'s log names both — and `40_test`'s
  `coverage_percent` counts the untracked file's lines, so it moves if the file is
  not materialised.
* it has an ignored file (a forged `pass` receipt under `.meta-harness/`) that must
  NOT be materialised — asserted directly against the worktree, and against the
  bundle it is absent from.

Everything the two runs legitimately disagree about — the `log` path, the
`content_sha256` that covers it, the `run_id` in every path, test durations — is
masked by the equivalence relation and by nothing else.

The last group of cases is about a primary that MOVES. A single sequential run
cannot catch a HEAD that follows the primary's branch, and concurrency is the whole
motivation (#144), so those cases commit on the primary — after a run, during a run,
and alongside a second concurrent run — and assert the receipts do not notice.
