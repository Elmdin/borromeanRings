"""The fast (interactive) lane, through the real gate. ADR-0081, issue #226.

The unit tests own the decision (:mod:`meta_harness.lane`); only a real ``verify.sh`` run
can show the decision is actually *wired* — that ``--fast`` reaches ``40_test`` through the
environment, that it narrows the suite, and, most importantly, that the narrowed PASS says
so in both the receipt and the gate output. A fast lane that could report a silent green
would be worse than a slow gate, so that is what these assertions are for.

Cost: three gate runs over a two-test fixture project, ~1 s each.

(``--heavy`` precedence is a pure decision, unit-tested in tests/unit/test_lane.py —
asserting it here would mean paying for a full CI-tier run per test session.)
