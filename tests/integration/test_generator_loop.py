"""Generator-loop conformance: the headless driver, end to end (SPEC-generator.md §5).

The four scenarios of §3.2 are driven for real — a real `generate.sh`, a real gate, real
receipts — against throwaway fixture projects built in tmp. Each asserts the outcome the
spec names *and* the evidence behind it (how many times the gate actually ran, which
check ids the retry named, whether the counter survived), because an outcome alone can be
produced by a loop that is right for the wrong reason.

Two negative fixtures sit alongside them: a generator that resets the gate's retry
counter, and one that edits a receipt in an earlier bundle. Neither is asked politely not
to; both are caught. A third, `commit_only.sh`, discriminates the correction ADR-0078
made to N3 — it changes what the gate reads without changing a single file.

Repo-root paths (``generate.sh``, ``.claude/hooks/``, ``tests/fixtures/``) are read here,
which is why this file lives under ``tests/integration/`` and is excluded from mutmut's
copied working dir — see ADR-0022 and ``setup.cfg``.

**Assert our own words, never another tool's.** Every string matched below is produced by
`generate.sh`, `stop_gate.sh` or a fixture in this repo. Matching git's error prose, or
assuming git's default configuration, couples a verdict to a release or a machine: CI once
went red here on nothing but `error: unrecognized input` (git 2.34) becoming `error: No
valid patches in input` (git 2.55). ADR-0077 pins the tools whose output decides a verdict,
but only Python distributions — git cannot be pinned that way, so for it the rule is not to
depend on the prose at all. See ADR-0078.
