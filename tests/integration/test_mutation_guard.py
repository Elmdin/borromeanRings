"""End-to-end: the mutation lane fails closed on zero evaluated mutants, and says so.

The shape this pins was seen on PRs #160 and #168. mutmut copies only ``src/``,
``tests/``, ``setup.cfg`` and ``pyproject.toml`` into ``mutants/`` and runs pytest with
that directory as cwd. A unit test that reads any other repo path (``.claude/``,
``contracts/``, ...) passes on the fast lane and fails inside the sandbox; mutmut's
clean-test run then aborts, 0 mutants are evaluated, and the vacuous score is 1.0.
ADR-0022 says ``60_mutation`` must FAIL there ("MUTATION CHECK DID NOT RUN"), never
trust that 1.0 — this test proves it against the real ``verify.sh --heavy``.

It also asserts the gate's verdict row carries the evaluated-mutant count
(``PASS (evaluated N, score S)`` / ``FAIL (evaluated 0)``), so a reader never has to
open the log to learn whether mutmut did any work. See issue #187.

Cost: two heavy-gate runs on a one-function fixture, ~30 s each on a dev laptop (mutmut
itself is ~4 s; the rest is the full check set the gate runs regardless). This file
drives the heavy lane through bash, so it is in ``setup.cfg``'s mutmut ignore list.

The second run also proves the check clears the stale ``mutants/`` copy itself (mutmut
never deletes a file it already copied), so a removed test cannot keep failing the lane.
