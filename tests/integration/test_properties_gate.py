"""End-to-end: tier 1 of the verification ladder, run through the real gate.

The rule under test is binary and threshold-free (nothing is counted, ever), and it
has one sharp edge: a project that *declares* a property directory and puts nothing in
it must **fail**, not pass and not `noop`. A declaration is an affirmative claim, and a
claim with no evidence behind it is the vacuity ADR-0049 exists to catch — accepting it
would make the declaration free.

Each test drives the real ``verify.sh`` against a fixture project (built in tmp, never
committed) and asserts the end-to-end verdict *and* the receipt status, because "the
gate went green" and "this check actually looked at something" are different facts.

See docs/specs/SPEC-verification-ladder.md and ADR-0074.
