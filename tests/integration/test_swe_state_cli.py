"""End-to-end: ``swe-state.sh`` and ``status.sh --swe`` on a real governed fixture.

The fixture is gated ONCE through the real ``verify.sh`` so its ``last_verdict.json`` is
the gate's own record: ``14_container`` reports ``noop`` (no Dockerfile) and
``21_archetype`` reports ``fail`` (a declared ``cli`` with no documented usage). The
report must then say exactly that — and, in the fixed order, what to adopt next.
See docs/specs/SPEC-swe-state.md §4.5 and §6.
