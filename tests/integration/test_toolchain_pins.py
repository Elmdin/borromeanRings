# the `shellcheck-py` wheel is versioned 0.11.0.1 while the binary it ships reports
# 0.11.0, so following the assertion's own advice produces a drift on a correctly pinned
# machine. Worse, `command -v shellcheck` finds whichever shellcheck is on PATH — here a
# conda binary, on a runner the image's — which is not the wheel at all, and succeeds
# even when the wheel is absent. That is precisely the shim problem this module exists to
# catch, reintroduced by the fix for it.
#
# So a binary whose reported version is not its distribution's version cannot be verified
# this way, and must not be added here. Give it a check-specific version assertion
