"""Unit tests for the predicate lint (meta_harness.predicates).

Predicates are the checkable statements this repo's documents make: SPEC ``Contract`` /
``Guarantees`` / ``Acceptance`` bullets, ADR ``Consequences`` bullets phrased as
obligations, and issue-form task-list items. Two defects are mechanical: a hedge word
that leaves a predicate with no yes/no answer, and a SPEC nothing points back to (an orphan).
See docs/specs/SPEC-predicates.md and ADR-0064.

# SPEC — Example

## Problem
Prose with as needed in it is not a predicate.

## Contract
`23_predicates` fails closed on any hedge.
- The check fails on a hedged predicate.
- A wrapped item
  continues on the next line and mentions as needed here.
1. Numbered items count too.
   - nested bullets as well, verified by test_example.py
```
- inside a fence: a meaningful healthcheck (skipped)
```

## Design
- Design bullets are not predicates, even if reasonable.

## Guarantees
- **Deterministic** — the same input yields the same output.
